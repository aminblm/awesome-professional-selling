#### This is marketing

- Marketers are change-makers.
- Marketing shapes culture.
- You are a marketer if you help make your customers/users a better version of themselves through your products/services.
- Start with empathy. Address a need rather than inventing one.
- Everybody is not your target audience.
- Identify the smallest viable market (SVM) for your product/service.
- Tell a story that is relatable and worth being a part of for your SVM.
- Show up regularly, consistently, day after day!
- Create tension among customers and not stress.
- Committed, creative people can change the world.
- Make the change with intent.
- What others say about you/your company/product/service is more important than what you say about it.
- Focus on psychographics than just demographics.
- Make the idea/product/service easy to spread.
- Earn and keep the attention and trust of those you serve.
- Early adopters are not necessarily adapters. They crave the new.
- Combine two offerings - free ideas that spread and expensive expressions of those ideas that are worth paying for.
- It is better to market to connected tribes. If your product/service is worthy, they will do the marketing for you.
- Get comfortable with uncertainty.
- Don't find customers for your product. Design products for your customers.
- The best marketers are farmers, not hunters.
- Perfect closes the door. Better opens the door.


9 Takeaways from ‘This is Marketing’ by Seth Godin
Brand & Design
Mar 8 
Written By Raechel Lambert

The way we serve our tribe of early-stage founders is by understanding what makes up great marketing and curating the best strategies. This Is Marketing often tops the list of best marketing books and I highly recommend consuming it yourself. I listened to the audiobook and am sharing the key takeaways with you here. 

About Seth Godin
Seth Godin is a prolific writer and genius marketer with 18 bestselling books, including This Is Marketing, Permission Marketing, and Tribes. His daily blog is read by millions. 
He believes that marketers don’t just make noise; they make the world better and that truly powerful marketing is grounded in generosity, empathy, and emotional labor.
Key takeaways from This is Marketing—You Can’t Be Seen Until You Learn to See 
1 What marketers do
Marketers make change happen for the smallest viable market and by delivering anticipated, personal, and relevant messages that people actually want to get.
2 People like us do things like this
Everyone always acts in accordance with their internal narrative. Changing our behavior is driven by a desire to fit in (people like us do things like this) and our perception of status (affiliation and dominance).
3 Marketing in 5 steps:
- Invent a thing worth making, with a story worth telling, and a contribution worth talking about
- Design and build it in a way that a few people will particularly benefit from and care about
- Tell a story that matches the built in narrative and dreams of that tiny group of people—the smallest viable market
- Spread the word
- Show up, regularly, consistently, and generously for years and years to organize and lead and build confidence in the change you to seek to make. To earn permission to follow up and to earn enrollment to get to teach.
4 Marketing Driven vs. Market Driven
A marketing-driven organization is run by the Marketing department. It revolves around what marketers do.
A market-driven organization is driven by what the market wants, regardless of what the marketing department feels like doing.
5 You must begin with a world view and invite people who share that world view to join you.
Example: Former CEO Ron Johnson of JC Penney's came from Apple in 2011. Johnson liked luxury goods and had a world view that retail shopping at a quality retailed should be high end. So he cut discounts and flash sales. JC Penny’s sales plummeted more than 50%. Ron Johnson failed to understand that JC Penny’s tribe did not share his world view and the JC Penney's board failed to appoint a leader that shared the same world view as their customers. The moral of the story is that hiring people who have been successful in the past means nothing if their worldview isn’t aligned.
6 The three-sentence marketing promise template

My product is for people who believe technology will change the world for the better. 
I will focus on people who want to build amazing technology. 
I promise that using my product will help you get all the necessary tools to build your dream like technology.
7 Ten things your story needs to do
- Connect us to our purpose and vision for career and biz
- Allow us to celebrate our strengths by remembering how we got here
- A deeper understanding of our unique value and what differentiates us
- Reinforce our core values
- Help us to act in alignment and make value-based decisions
- Encourage us to respond to customers instead of reacting to the marketplace
- Attract customers who want to support businesses that reflect or represent their values
- Build brand loyalty and give customers a story to tell
- Attract the kind of like-minded employees we want
- Help us to stay motivated and cont to do work we're proud of
But your story is a hook, and now you're on the hook to deliver, which is a high-risk path. Great marketing is the generous and audacious work of saying, I see a better alternative, come with me.
8 Simple three-step narrative for action
Marshall Ganz, a Harvard professor who has worked with both Cesar Chavez and Barack Obama, has articulated a simple three-step narrative for action: the story of self, the story of us, and the story of now. 
- Story of self gives you a platform to speak.
- Story of us is the kernel of the tribe—why are we alike and why is your story relevant to the tribe?
- Story of now is the critical pivot—it enlists your tribe on your journey.
9 The tyranny of perfect and the possibility of better
Perfect closes the door. It asserts we're done and that it’s the best we can do. Perfect forbids us to try. But the possibility of better opens the door. Better challenges us to try and gives us a chance to improve the lives of the people we seek to serve.

This Is Marketing (dot point) Summary
- Chapter 1 – Not mass, not spam, not shameful
- “in this book we’re working together to solve a set of related problems”
- how to spread your ideas
- how to make the impact you seek
- how to improve the culture
- In the world the culture has changed
- Instead of selfish mass, effective marketing now relies on empathy and service
- Marketing is not a battle, it’s not a war, or even a contest
- marketing is the generous act of helping someone solve a problem – THEIR problem
- it’s a chance to change the culture for the better
- marketing involves very little in the way of shouting, hustling or coercion
- It’s a chance to serve, instead
- The lock and the key
- It doesn’t make sense to make a key and then run around looking for a lock to open
- The only productive solution is to find a lock and then fashion a key
- SO: It’s easier to make products and services for the customers you seek to serve than it is to find customers for your products and services
- Marketing doesn’t have to be selfish
- in fact, the best marketing never is
- marketing is a generous act of helping others become who they seek to become
- it involves crafting stories – honest stories that resonate and spread
- Marketers offer solutions, opportunities for humans to solve their problems and move forward
- the other type of marketing – the hype, scams and pressure – thrives on selfishness
- i know that in the long run it doesn’t work
- and you can do better… we all can
- It’s time
- time to get off the social media merry-go-round that goes faster and faster but never gets you anywhere
- time to stop hustling and interrupting
- time to stop spamming and pretending that you’re welcome
- time to stop making average stuff for average people while hoping you can charge more than a commodity price
- time to stop begging people to become your clients, and time to stop feeling bad about charging for your work
- time to stop looking for shortcuts, and time to start insisting on a long, viable path instead
 
- Chapter 2 – The marketer learns to see
- Marketing in five steps
- THE FIRST STEP is tp invest a thing worth making, with a story worth telling, and a contribution worth talking about
- THE SECOND STEP is to design and build it in a way that a few people will particularly benefit from and care about
- THE THIRD STEP is to tell a story that matches the built-in narrative and drams of that tiny group of people, the smallest viable market
- THE FOURTH STEP is the one everyone gets excited about: spread the word
- THE LAST STEP is often overlooked: show up – regularly, consistently, and generously, for years and years – to organise and lead and build confidence in the change you seek to make. To earn permission to follow up and to earn enrolment to teach.
- Exec summary
- Ideas that spread win
- Marketers make change happen for the smallest viable market
- And by delivering anticipated, personal and relevent messages that people actually want to get
- Marketers don’t use consumers to solve their problem, they use marketing to solve consumers problems
- Things marketers know
- committed, creative people can change the world (in fact, they’re the only ones that do)
- you can do it right now, and you can make more change than you can possibly imagine
- You cannot change everyone, therefore asking ‘who is it for?’ cna focus your actions and help you deal with the nonbelievers
- (in your head and in the outside world)
- Change is best made with intent
- “what is it for?” is the posture of work that matters
- Human beings tell themselves stories
- Those stories, as far as each of us is concerned, are completely and totally true, and it’s foolish to try to persuade them (or us) otherwise
- We can group people into stereotyped groups that often tell themsleves similar stories
- groups that make similar decisions based on their perceived status and other needs
- What you say isn’t nearly as important as what others say about you.
 
- Chapter 3 –  Marketing changes people through stories, connections, and experience
- Each person has a story in his or her head, a narrative used to navigate the world
- The extraordinary thing is that every person’s narrative is different
- That riff about the quarter-inch drill bit
- Harvard marketing professor Theodore Levitt famously said “people don;t want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit, they want a quarter-inch hole”
- the lesson is that the drill bit is merely a feature, a means to an end, but what people truly want is the benefit, the hole it makes
- But that doesn;t nearly go far enough
- No one wants a hole.
- what people want is the shelf that goes on the wall after they drill the hole
- actually, what thjey want is how they’ll feel once they see how uncluttered everything is, when they put their stuff on the shelf
- BUT… they also want the satisfaction of knowing they did it themselves
- OR – perhaps the increase in status they’ll get when their spouse admires their work
- OR – the peace of mind that comes from knowing that the bed room isn;t a mess, and that it feels safe and clean
- OR – they’ll stack books on the shelf to show off how smart they are when they invite friends over
- “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill bit. They want to feel safe and respected”
- Why do people who never drive off road buy a 90,000$ Toyota Land Cruiser?
- People don’t want what you make
- They want what it will do for them
- they want how it will make them feel
- there actually aren;t that many feelings to choose from
- most marketers deliver the same feelings, we just do it in different ways, with different services, products, and stories, and we do it for different people in different moments
- If you can bring someone belonging, connection, peace of mind, status, or one of the other most desired emotions, you’ve already done something worthwhile
- The thing you sell is simply a road to achieve those emotions, and we let everyone down when we focus on the tactics, not the outcomes
- “Who’s it for?” and “What’s it for?” are the two questions tat guide all of our decisions
 
- Chapter 4 – The Smallest Viable Market
- “What change are you trying to make?”
- it’s a simple question, but a loaded one, because it implies that you’re responsible
- you are an actor with intent, an agent of change, a human being working hard to change other human beings
- denying this is a form of hiding – it’s more productive to own it instead
- Stumble 1: it’s tempting to pick a grandiose, nearly impossible change
- “I want to change the face of education worldwide” OR “I want to revolutinoise the oil industry” – these are great, but it’s never been done before with a person of our level of resources
- game-changing home runs are great, and it’s inspiring to see people try to beat the odds and change everything… BUT…
- That’s a heavy burden, as well as a convenient excuse in times of despair
- it’s no wonder that you’re stuck – you’re seeking to do the impossible
- perhaps it makes more sense to begin with a hurdle you can leap
- perhaps it makes sense to be very specific about the change you seek to make, then go and make it happen
- then, based on that success, you can replicate the process on ever bigger challenges
- Stumble 2: you want to defend what you’re already doing, which is selling what you’ve already been charged with selling
- so we trick ourselves by reverse-engineering the ‘change’ we want to make and force it to fit in with what we’re currently doing (rather than being with the change first, then work out the WHAT second)
- “Who are you seeking to change?”
- it’s quite clear that you can’t change EVERYONE
- so you need to change SOMEONE (a group of someones)
- to find that group, they need to share someone – perhaps their demographics (their geography, age, income, etc), but a better way is by Psychographics (they way they think and feel, the stories they tell themselves)
- eg: Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks both sell coffee, but for the first 20 years of their battle they didn’t market to the same groups. Dunkin Donuts osld to taxi drivers and construction workers, Starbucks served people with very specific beliefs about money, community, opportunity, luxury and time
- Worldviews
- Begin by choosing people based on what they dream of, believe, and want, not based on what they look like
- A ‘worldview’ as a shortcut, a lens each of us use when we see the world – it’s our assumptions, biases, stereotypes
- when you’re picking a group based on psychographics, you need to map their worldviews. When you do, you can become clearer about what they might want and you’ll be better placed to make something for them that they might buy
- Forcing a focus
- Relentless pursuit of mass will make you boring, because mass means average, it means the centre of the curve, it requires you to try to offend no one and satisfy everyone
- it leads to compromises and generalisations
- INSTEAD – begin with the Smallest Viable Market – wbatis the minimum number of people you would need to influence to make it worth the effort?
- The smallest viable market is the focus that, ironaically and delightfully, leads to your growth
- ‘Specific’ is a kind of bravery
- specific means accountable – it worked or it didn;t, it spread or it didn;t, it matched or it didnt
- are you hiding beyong ‘everyone’ or ‘anyone’? you’ll never be able to serve everyone, which is comforting since you’re less likely to be disappointed when it doesn’t happen
- Everything gets easier when you walk away from the hubris of ‘everyone’ – your work is not for everyone, it’s only for those who signed up for the journey
- “it’s not for you”
- we’re not supposed to say that, but we must
- ‘it’s not for you’ shows the ability to respect someone enough that you’re not going to waste their time, pander to them, or insist that they change their beliefs
- It also shows respect for those that you DO seek to serve, when you say to them ‘I made this for you – not for other folks, but for YOU’
- Because it doesn;t matter what people you’re not seeking to serve think. what matters is whether you’ve change the people who trust you, the people who have connected with you, the poeple you seek to serve
- Everyone best-selling book on Amazon has at least a few 1-star reviews. It’s impossible to create work that matters AND please everyone
- The simple marketing promise
- My product is for people who believe __________
- I will focus on people who want ____________
- I promise that engaging with what I make will help you get ______DO FOR WYWL EXAMPLE
 
- CHAPTER 5. In Search of “Better”
- Empathy is at the heart of marketing
- People don’t believe what you believe
- They don’t know what you want
- Everyone has noise in their heads
- Everyone thinks they are right
- Everyone has an impulse to make things better
- Everyone is lonely, insecure and a bit of a fraud.. And everyone cares about something
- Better isn’t up to you
- Out of the hundreds of models of insurance, motorcycles or ketchup, how do we remember this or choose a product>
- We remember the best one – the best for us
- If we care about sustainability and price, then our brain has a slot for our favorite brand, and that’s the one that’s best at sustainability and price – no surprise
- But our neighbour who cares about status within a group and luxury has a very different brand in mind
- Positioning as a service
- Begin with an audience worth serving
- Pick two axis (lets do a real one on this)
- Speed, price, performance, ingredients, purity, obviousness, safety, edgeness
- Some potato chips are healthy and organic, others are traditional and satisfying
- Could do What You Will Learn as a category e.g
- Choose your axis, choose your future
- When you look at attributes its tempting to pick the ones most people care about the most
- The popular one – you will choose a crowded quadrant
- Everything that we purchase – every investment, every trinket, every experience – is a bargain
- we pay less for it than the value it is worth to us (otherwise we wouldn’t buy it at all)
- it’s worth more than we paid for it
- If a prospect understands what is on offer and chooses not to purchase it, then it’s not for them (at least, not today, not at this price, not with this structure). That’s OK too
- What’s a car for?
- a teenager’s first car (for the teenager) = independence and freedom, and shift in status and power and perception
- a teenager’s first car (for the parent) = a symbollic gesture to offer freedom and responsibility, and an opporunity to talk about control, safety, decisions and status
 
- 6. Beyond commodities (aka empathy level 2 …)
- Problem first
- Our calling is to make a difference, to make things better for those we seek to serve
- the opportuntiy to choose a path and follow it is not about our own benefit, but because of what it can produce for others
- to go beyond the commodity and make true change, beyond the quarter-inch drill bit or the quarter-inch hole, the change we’re making is on the emotional level
- The commodity suckout
- if you make somethign that others make, if it’s comething we can find on upwork, amazon, alibaba or fiverr, you’ve got a pain
- the pain is that if you try to raise your price in order to make a decent return on the effort you’re putting in, customers will just go elsewhere and find someone cheaper
- now, people know more than you do about your prices and about your competitors. if you’re doing work that is a commodity, it won’t ever be enough
- Authenticity VS Emotional Labour
- Emotional Labour is the work of doing what we don’t feel like doing
- it’s about showing up with a smile when we’re wincing inside, or resisting the urge to chew someone out because you know that engaging will make a far bigger difference
- It takes only a small amount of energy and guts to be Authentic – to act the way you feel, to ‘be yourself’
- you need to feel confident enough to let your true feelings be exposed, knowing that rejection means it’s personal
- BUT there’s also a lot of room to hide – “if all you do is follow your muse and ‘be yourself’, you may find that your muse is a chicken that is steering you away from important work
- “If your authentic you is a selfish jerk, please leave him at home”
- “If you need to be authentic to do your best work, you’re not a professional, you’re a fortunate amateur”
- For the rest of us, there’s the opportunity to be a professional, to exert emotional labour in search of empathy – the empathy to imagine what someone else would want, what they might believe, what story would resonate with them
- we don’t do this work because we feel like it in the moment – we do this work, this draining emotional labour, because we’re professionals, and because we want to make change happen
- Emotional Labour is the work we do to provide service
 
- Chapter 7 The canvas of dreams and desires
- What do people want?
- If you ask them, you probably won;t get the right answer, or you certainly won’t find anything groundbreaking
- it’s our job to watch people, figure out what they dream of, and then create a transaction that can deliver that feeling
- Three common confusions most of us get stuck on
- 1: we confuse WANTS and NEEDS. we need air, water, health, and a roof over our heads. pretty much everything else is a want, so we should treat it as such
- 2: people are intimately aware of their wants (which they think of as needs) BUT they are absolutely terrible at inventing new ways to address those wants. They often prefer a familiar solution to satisfy their wants, even if its not working very well
- 3: mistakenly believing that everyone wants the same thing. we don’t. some people want things that are brand new, some people want things to never change.some want chocolate, some want vanilla, some want butter pecan (throwback to The Dip episode)
- Don’t begin with you machines, your inventory, your factory, your tactics
- don’t begin with what you know how to do or some sort of distraction about your mission
- Instead, begin with the dreams and fears, with emotionak states, and with the change your scustoemrs seek to make
- SEE PAGE 80 FOR LIST OF DREAMS/EMOTIONS/FEARS
- Nobody needs your product
- You might sell white leather wallets, and you might think “everyone needs a white leather wallet”
- FIRSTLY – the don’t NEED a wallet. they might WANT a wallet, but thats different
- SECONDLY – people might decide that they want a white leather wallet, but it isn;t because they want a white leather wallet… they want how it will make them FEEL to pull a white leather wallet out of their pocket when it’s time to pay.
- Identify that FEELING first before you spend any time or money making a wallet
- What do YOU want
- Seth – “let me guess”
- “you’d like to be respected, successful, independent, appropriately busy, and maybe a little famous. you’d like to do work you’re proud of and do it for people you care about
- what’s NOT on the list? a certain colour car, a certain job title, the number of bedrooms in your house…
- the details don;t matter so much – we all want similar things, but the details of how we got about getting those things can differ drastically
- Always be testing
- you don;t know the answer
- so take the cheap and fun option – test it first, be wrong, and tweak until you get it close to right
 
- CH8 – More of the Who: Seeking the smallest viable market
- A tough exercise
- Why don’t people choose you?
- To go to the next level of empathy, you need to ask some hard questions
- the people who DON’T buy from you, who happily buy from a competitor even though they kn ow you exist… WHY ARE THEY RIGHT?
- Why are the people who don’t choose you correct in their decision to not choose you?
- Understand why people DO choose you, and undertsnad and respect why people DON’T choose you
- when we find the empathy to say “I’m sorry, this isn’t for you – here’s the phone number of my competitor” then we also find the freedom to do work that matters
 
- Ch9 – People like us do things like this
- A strong driver for why we do what we do (and why we buy what we buy) as the DESIRE TO FIT IN
- We do things in accordance with our own internal narratives, but we also do things in accordance with our ‘tribes’ (people like us – a desire to fit in – a desire to affiliate)
- The internal narrative
- We buy the $700 stroller because it’s smart (or we don;t because it’s stupid)
- we shop at the farmers market to get fresh healthy food (or we dont because it’s raining and they don’t sell cheetos)
- we wear chinos with boat shoes and no so dh because that how successful people dress (or we don’t because that’s how wankers dress)
- all of the decisions we make are based on our internal narratives and the stories we tell ourselves, and these stories are driving by asking what types of groups we want to belong to, who we want the ‘people like us’ to be
 
- Ch11 – status, dominance, affiliation
- Status roles determine who gets to eat first in the lion pack
- The desire to change or protect our status drives almost everything we do
- Status, dominance, and affiliation
- DO WE INCLUDE THIS? PRETTY IMPORTANT SECTION, BUT PRETTY BIG SECTION POTENTIALLY
- Bets bits:
- Baxter hates Truamn (set up) [123]
- Sex things about status [129]
- The alternative to dominion is affliation [137]
- Sending affiliation signals [139]
- Maybe?
 
- Ch15 – Reaching the right people
- Brand marketing vs direct marketing
- Direct marketing is action orientated and is measured
- If you’re buying direct marketing ads measure everything
- Brand marketing is culturally oriented and can’t be measured
- If you’re buying these ads be patient
- Refuse to measure, engage with culture
- If you can’t afford to be patient, don’t pay for brand marketing ads
- You certainly don’t have enough time and money to build a brand for everyone – don’t try
- Be specific
- Goals, Strategies & Tactics
- tactics are easy to understand because we can list them
- Strategy is more amorphous – it’s the umbrella over your tactics, the thing that your tactics seek to support
- If you tell your competition about your tactics, they’ll steal them. If you tell your competition about your strategy, it won’t matter because the guts or the persistence to take your strategy and try to make it their strategy
- The goal is the shining light, the unwavering destination of your work (the change you’re seeking to make)
- Online advertising
- more than ever
- you can reach people more precisely online than in any other medium (not just demographics, but even psychographics too)
- you can reach people instantly (you can set up an ad at 10:00am and it reaches people at 10:01am)
- you can measure everything
- but less than ever
- even though its faster, cheaper, and more measurable than ever before, its also the most ignored advertising ever created
- “earned” VS “unearned” attention
- Brand marketing makes magic, Direct marketing makes the phone ring
- Direct Marketing is action oriented, and it’s measured
- Brand Marketing is culturally oriented, and it can’t be measured
- BIG KEY OF THE BOOK:
- If you’re buying Direct Marketing ads, measure everything. compute how much it costs you to earn attention, to get a click, to turn that attention into an order. Direct marketing is action marketing, and if you’re not able to measure it,. it doesn;t count
- If you’re buying Brand Marketing ads, be patient. Refuse to measure. Engage with the culture. Focus, by all means, but mostly, be consistent and patient. If you can’t afford to be consistent and patient, don’t pay for brand marketing ads.
- A simple guide to online direct marketing
- The ad exists to get a click
- the click exists to either make a sale or earn permission
- The sale exists to lead to another sale, or to word of mouth
- Permission exists to lead to education and to a sale
- That’s it.
- A simple guide to brand marketing
- Everything you do, from the way you answer the phone to the design of your packaging, from the hold music to the behaviour of your executives, even the type of packaging you use – all of it is a form of marketing your brand
- You can’t measure it, you might not even notice – but it still matters
- Search engine optimisation
- You might think keep chipping away at SEO is worth it because eventually someone might accidentally click on your site because you ranked high
- But the path isn’t to be found when someone type a generic term
- The path is to have someone care enough about you and what you create that they’ll type in your name – that they’ll be looking for YOU, not a generic alternative
- Step 1 = make a product or service that people care enough to search for specifically. You cannot win every generic search, but you’ll always win if the search is specific enough
- Step 2 = To be the one they want to find what they go looking
 
- Ch16 – Price is a story
- Pricing is a vital marketing decision
- A porsche cayonne has no conceivable utility proportionate to its expense
- Its merely a signal,  a silver or red painted flag in our driveway and in the theater of our self esteem
- “Cheap” is another way to say “scared”
- unless you’ve found an extraordinary way to deliver your service or product, racing to be the cheapest probably means that you’re not investing sufficiently in change
- When you’re the cheapest, you’re not promising change. You’re promising the same, but cheaper.
- lowering you price doesn;t make you more trusted – it actually does the opposite
- The race to the bottom is tempting, because nothing is easier to sell than ‘cheaper’ – but low price is the last refuge of the marketer who has run out of generous ideas
- And what about free?
- $9 is a dollar less than $10, but free is not a dollar less than $1. It’s a compeltely different category when it;s free
- A free idea has more of a chance to spread further and quicker than an idea that’s tied to money
- if facebook charged $3/month to use, it wouldn’t have billions of users
- if it cost the consumer to listen to the radio, there woujld be no more Top 40
- But price tells a story, and speding money in a trtansaction has some imrpotant effects for the marketer and the consumer
- 1 – if you pay for something, you treat it very differently than if you got it for free. scarcity, tension, fear and enrolment all exist when you have to pay money to make a purchase, so making something free means you lose a lot of these importsant elements
- 2 – without cashflow, the business can;t reinvest in makng better products or better marketing
- The road out of the paradox is to combine the two married to eachother
- 1: Free ideas that spread
- 2: Expensive experssions of those ideas that are worth paying for
- now it’s your turn
- The tyranny of perfect
- Perfect closes the door
- it asserts that we’re done, that this is the best we can do
- Worse, perfect forbids us to try (to seek perfection then not reach it is a failure)
- The possibility of better
- Better opens the door
- better challenges us to see what’s there and begs us to imagine how we could improve on that
- better invites us in and gives us a chance to seek dramatic improvement on behalf of those we seek to serve
- The magic of good enough
- Good enough isn’t an excuse or a shortcut
- good enough leads to engagement
- engagement leads to truyst
- trust gives us a chance to see (if we choose to look)
- seeing allows us to learn
- learning allows us to make a promise
- a promise might earn enrolment
- enrolment is precisely what we need to achieve better
- Ship your work
- it’s good enough
- then make it better
- HELP!
- When we offer it, we’re being generous
- we we ask for it, we’re trusting someone else to see us and care about us
- On the other hand, when someone refuses to offer help or ask for it, everyone is closed, on defence, afraid of the other
- If there’s no connection, we can’t make things better.
- Marketing to the most important person
- We bring value to the world when we market
- If you don’t market the change you’d like to contribute then your stealing
- You are offering more value than your chaging
- If you hesitate to market your offering properly, its not that your being shy
- Its that your stealing
- Because there is someone out there who needs to elarn from you, engage with you or buy from you

What Is Market Design?
Market design is the act of creating an entirely new market for your product, claim the authors. You do this by devising a novel solution—not a solution that’s just better than other solutions—to an existing or not-yet-existing problem, often completely altering peoples’ lives and lifestyles and rendering old markets obsolete.

The Advantage of Market Design: You Can Become a Market Winner

Play Bigger Summary and Review
Play Bigger Key Idea #1:  Category kings find and develop solutions to problems that no one else has noticed.
Play Bigger Key Idea #2:  It can take a long time for people to change their minds. Category kings need to have great timing.
Play Bigger Key Idea #3:  You can discover opportunities for new categories using market and technology insights.
Play Bigger Key Idea #4:  Stories can help customers understand your business better and help motivate employees.
Play Bigger Key Idea #5:  The introduction of a new category in a market must be as dazzling as a strike of lightning.

Part 1: Defining Market Design and Market Winners

Part 2: The Three Steps of Market Design and Becoming a Market Winner
Step 1: Identify Your Market
Step 2: Identify and Express Your Company’s Take
Step 3: Implement Your Market Design Through a Big Event

A Big Event is an explosive occasion that introduces your company, market, and product to the world, assert the authors. This is the first step toward getting people to embrace your different (not better) approach to solving a problem. Ensure your Big Event is attention-grabbing and makes a mark in the customer’s mind—you must make a big impression to begin getting people to embrace a new market. 

Part 3: Remaining the Market Winner



Psychological Benefits of the Category King
Once the public understands the problem, people latch on to the most popular solution.

Category Discovery Steps
Step 1: Start with Who — CEO must be committed, but someone has to do the work
Step 2: Fact Finding Questions[These double as a pitch deck template]
- 		Vision mission: What was the original market or technology insight that led you to create this company?
- 		Customers: Who do you envision buying this product or service? Who will use it?
- 		Problem statement: What’s the problem you think you can solve for your potential customers?
- 		Use cases: What are the specific ways people will use this product or service to solve their problem?
- 		Product/solution: Give a detailed explanation of the technology behind the solution — what does it do now, and what else is it capable of doing?
- 		Ecosystem: In many cases there are other companies involved in solving the problem or adding additional value. These companies form an ecosystem around the problem and solution. What are all the companies and where in the ecosystem are the control points where one company has leverage?
- 		Competition: Who else is trying to solve this problem — or, if no one else sees the problem yet, who might jump in to compete with you to solve the problem once you identify it?
- 		Business model: How will your product or service change business for your customers? Will it increase their return on investment or reduce costs in a significant way? Or does it allow them to do something that couldn’t have been done with prior technology, creating huge value?
- 		Sales and go-to-market: Enterprise companies should articulate how the product or solution will make its way to the market. Through a sales force? Through distribution partners? Both? For a consumer company, how will users find out about your solution? From app stores? Search? Viral adoption? Growth hacking techniques? Advertising? PR?
- 		Organization: How is the company organized? Who are the major influencers on the company? How are decisions made? What kind of culture will work?
- 		Funding strategy: What’s the next funding event? A private financing? An IPO? How much runway does the company have before it needs more money and what kind of funding is in place to execute against the category strategy?
Step 3. Workshop — take a full day with your leadership team to debate and refine the answers to the questions above.
Step 4: Name the category — Keep it simple, powerful, clear, and different. 2–3 words that describe the problem of the category.
Step 5: Package the Work — after 10 revisions you can commit and start sharing the initial results.
- 		Category Landscape — what the category you create would look like and where it fits.
- 		Category Ecosystem — the customers, competitors, developers, suppliers, analysts, media, and everyone else who would plug into the category.
- 		Frotos — the from/to journey you want customers to take. Category Name and Description — the final version.
- 		The Case for tu he New Category — write out why the category should exist and what the world will look like if the company creates and dominates the category.
- 		Early Draft Game Plan — a sketch of how the company can create and dominate the category.
The purpose of packaging and presenting a category design document is to refine it, nail it down, and get complete buy-in. Once you commit to the new category, there is no turning back. You’ve got to burn the boats.

Category Design of Life
- 		Category is the Strategy — If you articulate the problem well, people will assume you know how to solve it. If you build a reputation as the go-to person to solve a particular problem, you will be much more in demand than the runner-ups.
- 		Fund your Category — Consider your skills and knowledge, and look for a unfulfilled need for it. If you don’t have the abilities to solve it, go get them. Always remember different versus better. When you seek better, you are moving into someone else’s territory, always fighting for attention and having to prove that you’re better.
- 		Design Three Legs of the Barstool at Once — Design yourself, what you can do, and your category together. Your value — however you want to measure it — is influenced by the potential market for what you do, your position in that market, and proof that you can deliver on your promise.
- 		Develop a Point of View — Your POV defined what type of person you are, what makes you different, and why people should care. And if you live your POV, it will attract the right people into your life, and repel the wrong people from your life.
- 		Condition the Market — A report to key superiors, or a presentation to colleagues, or the way you present yourself on LinkedIn or Twitter. After all, you’re trying to rearrange synapses in people’s brains so they can’t help but see the problem you define, and think of you as its solution.
- 		Design An Ecosystem — People need ecosystems, too. Individual category kings are good at building a community of supports, followers, partners, and colleagues. Do it purposefully.
- 		Fire up a Lightning Strike — Deadlines make things happen
- 		Establish Yourself, then Expand Your Category — Legendary category kings constantly look for ways to expand their categories, increasing their category potential. This is how you grow, open up new opportunities, and generate more demand for yourself.


Principle #1: Whoever frames the problem best has the best chance to win the category
Principle #2: Do it differently, not better
Principle #3: Have a point of view

What is positioning
Positioning is “the act of deliberately defining how you are the best at something that a defined market cares a lot about.”

Every single marketing and sales tactic that we use in business today uses positioning as an input and a foundation ⇒ If we fail at positioning, we fail at marketing and sales. If we fail at marketing and sales, the entire business fails.

Positioning as context 
Think of positioning as “context setting” for a product ⇒ good positioning provides the right clues to your potential customers so they have the right context to understand your product (or you; this applies to positioning yourself as well).

The components of positioning
Geoffrey Moore gave us the “positioning statement” in Crossing the Chasm:
For (target customer) who (statement of the need or opportunity), the (product name) is a (product category) that (statement of key benefit – that is, compelling reason to buy). Unlike (primary competitive alternative), our product (statement of primary differentiation).
The problem with the positioning statement is that it assumes you know the answers - but, you really don’t ⇒ positioning is the art of answering these blank questions… not writing them down.
While this framework doesn’t help us “do” positioning, it does start breaking down the components of positioning.

The components of positioning are:
- Competitive alternatives. What customers would do if your solution didn’t exist. 
- A competitive alternative is what your target customers would “use” or “do” if your product didn’t exist (e.g. a competitive solution, hire an intern, use a spreadsheet, do it manually, etc.)
- Here you want to understand what your customers compare your solution with ⇒ it’s the baseline for how they will decide whether you are “better”
- Unique attributes. The features and capabilities that you have and the alternatives lack.
- Think of unique attributes as your “secret sauce ⇒ the things you can do that your competitive alternatives can’t ⇒ the list of capabilities that you have and the alternatives don’t (e.g. technical features, business model, delivery model, specific expertise or experience, etc.)
- Here you want to make sure they are different when compared with the capabilities of your competitive alternatives from a customer’s point of view.
- Value (and proof). The benefit that those features enable for customers. 
- This is the benefit you can deliver to customers because of your unique attribute ⇒ it’s the reason why someone should care about your secret sauce ⇒ it should be as fact-based as possible. 
- Here you want to be able to prove your value in an objective way.
- Target market characteristics. The characteristics of a group of buyers that lead them to really care a lot about the value you deliver. 
- These are the characteristics of customers who care the most about the value your product delivers
- Market category. The market you describe yourself as being part of, to help customers understand your value.
- This is the “frame of reference” for your target market ⇒ this gives them the context to understand your unique value ⇒ this is one of the most important positioning decisions you will make because the market category you pick creates all kinds of assumptions for potential customers.
- Here you want to choose a market category that will make your unique characteristics “obviously awesome”.
- Relevant trends. Trends that your target customers understand and/or are interested in that can help make your product more relevant right now.
- Trends can help potential customers understand why your offering is something they need to pay attention to now. 



The 10-step positioning process
- Understand the customers who love your product
- Form a positioning team
- Align your positioning vocabulary and let go of your positioning baggage 
- List your true competitive alternatives 
You need to understand who your real competitors are in the minds of your customers ⇒ Understand what a customer might replace you with.
Ask yourself: “what would our best customers do if we didn’t exist?” ⇒ the answer might surprise you (it could even be “do nothing”).
Once you have a list, rank the competitive alternatives from most common to least common and focus on the most common ones ⇒ Ask yourself: “what would the majority of your best customers really do?”

- Isolate your unique attributes or features 
- Map the attributes or features to value “themes” 
- Determine who cares a lot about what you are doing
- Find a market frame of reference that highlights your strengths and determine how to position it
- Head-to-Head ⇒ Position to win an existing market. 
- Here, you take on an existing market leader (if there is one) head to head and try to beat them and the existing players at their own game. 
- Potential customers are well educated about what solutions in this market can and cannot do and understand the purchase criteria (i.e. what is important to consider when making a purchase and what is not) ⇒ in other words, they’re educated buyers.
- With head-to-head, you’re claiming to be better for most, if not all, customers (not just a subsegment)
- Use this style when:
- When you are already a leader in the market,
- There is no market leader established yet, or
- A market shift has created an opportunity to take on an established leader (if you have the resources)
- To use this style, you need to:
- Determine whether or not the category has been created in the minds of enough customers to meet your business goals.
- Determine whether you can redefine the purchase criteria to your advantage.
- Determine whether you can move quickly enough to become the leader (this often requires venture capital and may not be suitable for bootstrappers.)
- Be prepared to compete with multiple competitors who will be simultaneously trying to prove they are better than you 
- Big Fish, Small Pond ⇒ Position to win a subsegment of an existing market. 
- Here, you avoid competing head to head by targeting a subsegment that is under- or un-served by existing players ⇒ you break the market into pieces and choose a piece you can win.
- With big fish, small pond, you’re claiming to be better for a subsegment of customers (not for most, if not all)
- Once you win your subsegment, you can expand from there until you are big enough (and ready) to take on the market leader.
- Use this style when:
- The market category is well defined (If the category is not well understood, subsegmenting it is only going to result in further market confusion.)
- There’s a clear market leader (and you’re not it)
- There is a clearly definable group of customers with unique needs that are not addressed by the market leader
- You are able to meet the unmet needs of the segment much better than the market category leader
- To use this style, you need to:
- Be careful that the market leader doesn’t turn their attention to the subsegment and beat you with a “good enough” solution (ideally your competitive advantage in this segment is hard for the market leader to copy)
- Create a New Game ⇒ Position to win a market you create. 
- Here you create a new market category in which you position yourself as the leader.
- This positioning approach usually is only possible when there is a massive paradigm shift in the market (due to new technology, economic changes, policy forces, etc.)
- This is the hardest positioning approach ⇒ With this approach, you have to create demand (i.e. You have to sell the category AND your product).
- Use this style only when:
- You have evaluated every other possible existing market category and you cannot position your offering head-to-head or as a big fish, small pond.
- To use this style, you need to:
- Explain why the category deserves to exist ⇒ answer the question, “why now?”
- Create a product that is new and different from what exists in other market categories ⇒ this requires shifting the way your customers think
- Sell the category first, and then position your product as the leader
- Raise enough capital to have the resources to both build the category and protect it from new entrants (Note: this approach also requires patient investors with deep pockets)

- Layer on a trend (if possible) 



- Make your positioning shareable
How to implement your new positioning

Once you have your positioning documented, it’s time to implement it.A great place to start is to develop a sales story that supports the positioning and use that to develop new messaging ⇒ The sales story works because it requires everyone to agree on how the positioning translates into a “pitch.”

Creating a sales story
A sales story generally has the following arc:
- It starts with a definition of the problem that your solution was designed to solve. 
- The story then moves to describing how customers are attempting to solve the problem today and where the current solutions fall short. 
- The next stage of the story is what April calls “the perfect world.” It’s where you describe what the features of a perfect solution would be, knowing what you know about the problem and the limitations of current solutions. 
- The sales story goes on to introduce the product or company and position it in the relevant market category. 
- Next, the story naturally flows into talking about each of the value themes with a bit more detail into how the solution enables that value.
- A completed sales deck also adds some information, such as handling common objections, a case study or list of current customers. 
- The story wraps up with a discussion of whatever you would like the prospect to do next.
Once the story arc is complete, the marketing team will translate it into messaging that can be used across the organization ⇒ Remember to document the messaging in a messaging document for easy reference, along with the positioning.
Positioning is never done - track it over time
Products and markets change over time.
You need to revisit positioning every six months or whenever something changes with your market including:
- A new competitor entering
- A shift in customer perception or evaluation
- A change in government regulations or economic climate
- New technology that impacts your market

How to Position Your Product in 12 Steps
Now, let’s move on to Dunford’s 12 steps that will let you avoid the above mistakes and position or reposition your product for maximum success.
Step 1: Identify your most eager customer and what they love about the product. Dunford writes that the first step of this process is to reflect on what aspects of your product make your customers happiest and what aspects of your top customers make them appreciate your product so much.
Step 2: Select a cross-company group to position your product. Next, assemble a group of employees from across the company who will define your current and new positioning.
Step 3: Develop an open mindset about the best positioning of the product. Once you have a group of people who will position your product, they must consciously set aside old conceptions of the product to have the openness to devise the best new positioning.
Step 4: Identify the alternatives to using your product. Now that you have an open-minded team, figure out together what your product’s real competition is—in other words, what alternative solutions your ideal customers would use if they didn’t have your product.
Step 5: List your product’s superior features. Now that you know what alternative solutions your customers compare you to, identify what features make your product different and better than those alternatives.
Step 6: Determine your features’ value to the customer. At this stage, you know what your product’s unique features are. Now, figure out how each feature adds value to your customer’s life.
Step 6.5: Gather like values together. Once you’ve determined the value of each feature, group these values together based on their relevance to the customer.
Step 7: Pinpoint customer segments most likely to buy your product. Once you have a good understanding of the value that your product delivers versus other alternatives, determine which customer segments care most about that value. Think about what makes some groups more excited about your product than others. Consider how to identify these groups. Make this group as specific and narrow as possible at this stage and then expand later if necessary.
Step 8: Sell your product in the right market, and dominate Ii. Now that you understand your competition, your superior features, and which customer segments to target, sell your product in a market that provides context on how to use it and that gives you the opportunity to dominate that market. You can try to dominate three types of markets, claims Dunford: an existing market, a subsegment of an existing market, and a new market.
Step 9: Optionally connect your product to a current trend. Now that you know what market to target, you might take advantage of a current trend to show that your product is relevant and useful to consumers now.
Step 10: Share the positioning across the company. Once you’ve positioned your product, communicate that position across the company through a positioning document so all departments can apply the positioning to what they do.
Step 11: Implement your positioning. Once you’ve completed the above steps, implement your positioning, says Dunford. There are two parts to this: creating a narrative about your product (this is the pitch with which your salespeople will approach prospects) and building your messaging (contained in your marketing to customers).
Step 12: Track your positioning, and adjust it if necessary. According to Dunford, the final piece of the positioning puzzle is to track the success of your positioning over time and make adjustments if needed. Assess your positioning every six months to learn if the market has changed and if you need to thus reposition your product.

How to Position Your Product like Your Company Depends on It (Hint: It Does)
Great positioning takes into account all of the following:
- The customer’s point of view on the problem you solve and the alternative ways of solving that problem.
- The ways you are uniquely different from those alternatives and why that’s meaningful for customers.
- The characteristics of a potential customer that really values what you can uniquely deliver.
- The best market context for your product that makes your unique value obvious to those customers who are best suited to your product.
THE FIVE (PLUS ONE) COMPONENTS OF EFFECTIVE POSITIONING
These are the Five (Plus One) Components of Effective Positioning:
- Competitive alternatives. What customers would do if your solution didn’t exist.
- Unique attributes. The features and capabilities that you have and the alternatives lack.
- Value (and proof). The benefit that those features enable for customers.
- Target market characteristics. The characteristics of a group of buyers that lead them to really care a lot about the value you deliver.
- Market category. The market you describe yourself as being part of, to help customers understand your value.
- (Bonus) Relevant trends. Trends that your target customers understand and/or are interested in that can help make your product more relevant right now.
2 traps to avoid when thinking about positioning:
- 		You get stuck on what you intended to build, and don’t realize that your product has changed.
- 		You stick with your default positioning, even when the market changes.


What is the Mom Test?
The Mom Test is a way to structure your idea validation conversations (i.e. “customer development interviews”) so that they lead to facts versus lies.
(If you can do this the right way, you should even be able to interview your Mom without allowing her to lie to you.)
To pass the Mom Test, you must:
- Talk about the person’s life instead of your idea
- Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future 
- Talk less and listen more

Best practices
Ask questions about your customers’ lives: their problems, cares, constraints, and goals. 
Gather as much information about them as you can.
Be careful with the 3 types of “bad data”:
- Compliments 
- Fluff
- There are 3 types of fluff:
- Generic claims (“I usually”, “I always”, “I never”) 
- Future-tense promises (“I would”, “I will”)
- Hypothetical maybes (“I might”, “I could”)
- Ideas

When this bad data creeps in (no big deal), just get back on track by:
- Deflecting compliments
- If you do get a compliment, pivot to understanding the “why” behind the compliment
- Anchoring fluff
- Use fluff answers, to transition to more concrete questioning and anchor them back to specifics in the past
- The past is more useful than the future
- People are overly optimistic about what they would do in the future, which leads to lies1
- Digging beneath ideas
- When people make requests, it provides an opportunity to dig into their motivations (which are useful —> jobs to be done)
- Dig = ask why questions
- Digging gives them permission to do a brain dump (which is great —> shut up and listen)

Avoid the desire to talk about your idea
Preparing for a good idea validation conversation
How long should interviews be?
Don’t “hard sell”, but do seek commitment


#### 3. Tuned in

#### 4. Made to stick

Chapter 1: Simple
Chapter 2: Unexpected
Chapter 3: Concrete
Chapter 4: Credible
Chapter 5: Emotional
Chapter 6: Stories

Prioritize the lead:
In journalism, the lead of a story is its first sentence. And it should contain its most essential elements. When writing your idea, you shouldn't get lost in the details, you should prioritize your lead.


1. Make it Simple
If you argue ten points, no one would remember any, even if they're good. To make you idea sticky, you should make it simple and strip it down to its core.
Have a Commander's Intent:
In the military, they say no plan survives contact with the enemy. Any plan can be made useless by your enemy's unpredictable moves. So the Army invented Commander's Intent. Which is the mission's core.
CI can be simple as: "break the enemy's will." It gives leaders and soldiers the ability to improvise tactics as needed, while adhering to the common intent.
Southwest Airlines is a very successful airline. One reason for that is having a core: We're the low-fare airline. It's a simple idea, and it helps guide employee actions. If you're an employee who is asked to decide whether to add a pricey chicken Caesar salad to the airline's menu because customers requested it, you'll reject the idea because it doesn't help being low-fare.
Prioritize the lead:
In journalism, the lead of a story is its first sentence. And it should contain its most essential elements. When writing your idea, you shouldn't get lost in the details, you should prioritize your lead.
The daily record is a very successful newspaper with extreme local focus. When asked why they're so successful, they reply with three reasons: "Names, Names, Names!" For them, adding a local person's name is more important than nuclear explosions in other communities. Having a clear core and prioritizing it helps employees make everyday decisions that aligns with paper's intent.
Use a schema
An easy way to make a new idea simpler is to use a concept your audience already know: a schema. You can teach students about the atom by saying "Electrons orbit the nucleus, much like planets orbit the sun."
Other examples:
- 		Pomelo is a super-sized grapefruit.
- 		The movie Speed is Die Hard on a bus.
- 		The movie Alien is Jaws on a spaceship.
Use generative analogies
Using analogies inspires novel thinking. Disneyland calls its employees "cast members." This inspires employees to think: "When we're walking in the park, we're on-stage." "We could never have a cigarette mid-scene."
2. Make it Unexpected
Unexpected ideas stick to our minds because it surprises us and gets our attention.
Getting attention
Break a pattern
The easiest way to get people's attention is to break a pattern.
A minivan TV ad starts: "Introducing the all-new Enclave". The whole family is sitting in the car, and dad starts the car and says "It's the minivan to the max." The ad continues with the minivan moving through streets, while the narrator is explaining its features. At an intersection, a speeding car barrels and the minivan makes a terrifying collision. "You didn't see that coming?" The ad was really created by the transportation department! This ad is unexpected. it breaks the pattern for car commercials.
Find the unexpected
To make your idea sticky, you need to avoid being common sense. "The low-fare airline" is common sense to employees, so they break expectations by saying they don't add chicken salad even if customers want it. "Names, names, names" is common sense for a local newspaper, so they surprise us by prioritizing the local person's name than nuclear explosions!
To make it unexpected, you need to find what are the unexpected consequences of your core message.
Nordstorm is a store known for outstanding customer service, even at the expense of efficiency. To train employees, they tell unexpected stories like "the Nordie who happily gift wrapped products a customer bought at Macy's." "The Nordie who refunded money for a set of tire chains, although Nordstorm doesn't sell tire chains!"
Keeping attention
Surprise gets our attention. Mystery and Interest keeps it.
If you want to teach students about the rings of Saturn, here is a good way to start: "Why does the rings of Saturn exist? Nothing else like them in out solar system! What are they made of? How could three groups of scientists come to very different conclusions?!" Then let the answer unfold like the plot of a mystery.
Aha! moments are powerful, especially if preceded by the Huh? experience.
The Gap Theory of curiosity: Curiosity happens when we want to fill a gap in our knowledge. When we want to know something but don't, it's like having an itch that we need to scratch. That's why sensational news can start with: "There is a new drug sweeping teenagers, and it may be in your own medicine cabinet!"
To make your Gap Theory work even better, make people commit to a prediction! The simple act of committing makes people more engaged and curious about the outcome. To know if they're right or wrong!
3. Make it Concrete
If you want your ideas to be sticky, avoid being abstract! Language is often abstract, but life is not!
"World-class customer service" is abstract, A Nordie ironing a customer's shirt is concrete.
Avoid abstract
East Asian children outperform children in Math. But what are Asian schools doing differently? 3 + 2 + 1 is meaningless to a three-year old. So, they explain it like this: "There are three kids playing ball. Two more came later, then one more joined them. How many are playing now?" Asian Math teachers emphasize things that are concrete and familiar.
Concreteness sticks, bicycle and avocado are easier to visualize and remember than justice and personality.
Fight the Curse of Knowledge
The difference between an expert and a novice is the ability to think abstractly. When you become an expert in chess, you'll more likely to talk about chess strategies rather than the act of moving bishops diagonally. When communicating, it's important to fight your curse of knowledge by being concrete.
One thing that made Sony successful is the pocketable radio idea. It was simple, unexpected (at the time, radios was like furniture), and concrete. It gave Sony engineers a clear and ambitious goal to achieve.
Kennedy said to the American people: "our goal is to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth". It's simple, unexpected (people didn't walk on the moon), and concrete.
4. Make it Credible
What makes people believe ideas? To persuade people into believing an idea, you and your idea should feel credible.
Add Authority
People who spread rumours know this! When it is health related, they attach FDA to it! It instantly becomes more believable.
If you can't find expert or celebrity endorsement, you can use anti-authority!
Use Anti-authority
If you're trying to teach people about the dangers of smoking, it can be highly effective to use anti-authority figures, like sharing smoker stories!
Use vivid details
Adding particular details to a story can make it more credible. Researchers have found that irrelevant details in a story can convince jury members in a trial. In a test, the story that contained "using a Star Wars toothbrush that looks like Darth Vader" was more believable. Even though it was irrelevant to the case.
Make statistics relatable
To show the devastating nuclear arsenal we have, doing this is much better than saying we have 5,000 nuclear warheads:
Drop a BB into an empty bucket. It makes a loud noise and say "This is Hiroshima bomb." Then drop 5,000 of them into the same bucket! and shout "This is what we have now." The noise will be terrifying, and your idea will stick!
In an organization saying: Only 37% of the org have understand what we're trying to achieve is worse than saying If a soccer team had these scores, only 4 of the 11 players would know which goal is theirs! Make it relatable.
Pass the big test
If you want your shipping company to be credible, you can use the fact that you handled Harry Potter delivery, which is extremely complicated to do. If you want to say that your textile products are free from hazardous chemicals. Say that you have edible textiles. They're safe enough to eat!
Make it testable
One Wendy campaign features a woman going to another store and says "Where's the beef?!" The commentator then says that Wendy has more beef than Whopper and Big Mac. The ad showed a real Wendy advantage, and encouraged people to go test that by themselves! The ad was very successful!
5. Make it Emotional
Mother Teresa: If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.
Avoid the analytical hat
In a study, a group was asked mathematical questions to analyze, and a second group was asked a question that made them feel. When they were asked to donate to a case later, the second group donated much more! Just putting our analytical hat makes us react to emotional appeals differently.
Tap into things we care about
Sportsmanship was a powerful idea in sports, but it started to be viewed as consolation prizes for losers who just don't do bad things. It lost the ability to motivate good behaviour. The founder of Positive Coaching Alliance rebranded it to Honoring the game. People care about the game, so it made it feel more patriotic. It implies that you owe your game some respect. The result was a dramatic reduction in basketball fouls!
In 1980s, Texas had a serious litter problem. The state was spending millions per year on cleanups, and the costs were rising. To solve the issue, they had to come with an emotional campaign: "Don't Mess with Texas!" TV ads featured beloved Texan athletes and musicians. The slogan was smart because it appeals to Texans identity. Within one year, litter declined by 29 percent!
6. Use Stories
Stories are retold because they contain wisdom. Stories teach us and inspire us to act.
The nurse and the baby
A nurse works at an intensive-care unit for babies. She's watching a baby who suddenly turns blue-black! The medical team gathers quickly, and assumes that the baby's lung had collapsed. But the nurse thought it was a heart problem, because this color reminded her of a baby who died of a condition where air fills the sac surrounding the heart. She said "It's the heart" and tried to stop preparations for the lung operation. But the medical team pointed at the heart monitor which seems fine. She insisted and tested the heartbeat using a stethoscope. There was no sound! An X-ray confirmed the result, so they treated the baby's heart. The baby's life was saved! Turns out that the heart monitor measures electrical activity, not actual heartbeats. Heart nerves were firing, but the air in the sac around the heart prevented it from beating!
Stories like these are effective teaching tools. It warns medical personnel about relying too much on machines. And it's also inspiring to everyone!
Jared's Tale
Jared had a serious weight problem. He wore size XXXXXXL shirts. Motivated by Subway's "7 under 6" campaign, he tried a sandwich and liked it. So he developed his own "Subway diet". After three months, he dropped almost 100 pounds. The story was written in a student magazine article. The story caught the attention of Subway's marketing team, and they turned it into one of their most successful ad campaigns!
It's simple, unexpected (fast food isn't healthy), concrete, credible (anti-authority), emotional (about an individual), and it's a story of overcoming big odds.
Sometimes finding great ideas is just a matter of spotting!
Effective stories
There are three effective story plots: Challenge, Connection, Creativity.
The challenge plot: The protagonist overcomes an intimidating challenge and succeeds. (Star Wars movies)
The connection plot: The leading characters develops a relationship that bridges a gap - racial, class, religious, etc. (Romeo and Juliet)
The creativity plot: The lead makes a mental breakthrough. (An apple falls on Newton's head)

### 5. 1-page marketing plan

Direct response marketing is designed to evoke an immediate response and compel prospects to take some specific action, such as opting-in to your email list, picking up the phone and calling for more information, placing an order or being directed to a web page. So what makes a direct response ad? Here are some of the main characteristics:
- It’s trackable.
- It’s measurable.
- It uses compelling headlines and sales copy.
- It targets a specific audience or niche.
- It makes a specific offer.
- It demands a response.
- Multi-step, short-term follow-up.
- Maintenance follow-up of unconverted leads.


Thus, the 1-Page Marketing Plan will be the most significant leverage point in any business. Using the Double Pareto principle, Dib believes that his practical, simple-to-use document will require 4% of the marketing effort to generate 60% of your business results.

The “Before” Phase
In the Before Phase of the 1-Page Marketing Plan, the goal is to get the prospect to know you and indicate interest. Prospects are the people that may not know that you or your company exists. 
Chapter 1 – Selecting Your Target Market


Instagram: @theprocesshacker
First, you need to select the right target market, so your marketing will be more useful for the amount of personal resources invested. You should avoid trying to target everyone or offering an extensive list of products and services. 
Focus On A Niche Market
Instead, you should narrow in on a niche:
Niche – a specialized target market for a particular kind of product or service that helps you:
- Allocate your limited money and become more relevant to prospects
- Allow you to dominate a category or geography
- Establish yourself as a specialist, so you can set your own prices
Target Using The PVP Index
The PVP Index helps you rate your ideal target market from a scale of 1 to 10:
- Personal Fulfillment (P): How much do you enjoy working in this niche with this customer type?
- Value to the Marketplace (V): How much are your customers willing to pay for your work?
- Profitability (P): How profitable is your work in this niche?
Create An Avatar
Additionally, you can dive into the mind your prospect by creating an avatar:
Avatar – a detailed expiration and description of your target customer and their lives that will help you get into their mind, understand their wants, and tailor your marketing to them

Chapter 2 – Crafting Your Message


Instagram: @theprocesshacker
Next, you should craft a compelling message to get your target market’s attention and impel them to respond. Most advertising is bland and ineffective. Instead, you should market on purpose with your advertising composed of two critical components:
- Purpose: What is the purpose of your advertising?
- Focus: What does your advertising focus on?
Each ad should have one clear objective to communicate to your prospect. Instead of selling right away, provide an easy call to action to show interest. Your message can be crafted in the various formats discussed below. To learn more about turning your message into a compelling story, check out the book, Building a StoryBrand (book summary).
Develop A Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
Amplify your marketing by developing a USP:
Unique Selling Proposition (USP) – the reason why your business exists, why someone should buy, and why some should choose you over your nearest competitor; has the following characteristics:
- Provide uniqueness that positions you differently
- Attract prospects before they have made a buying decision
- Avoid positioning yourself as a commodity and competing solely on price
- Avoid confusing prospects, as you will lose them
Create An Elevator Pitch
When asked the “what do you do?” question, you can respond with a version of your USP compiled into an elevator pitch:
Elevator Pitch – a concise, rehearsed summary of your business and its value proposition, which:
- Can be delivered in about 30-90 seconds or the time it takes to ride an elevator
- Focuses on the solution and the customer instead of the product and oneself
- Takes the prospect on a journey consisting of the problem, resolution, and proof: You know [problem]? Well, what we do is [solution]. In fact [proof].
Craft An Amazing Offer
Before creating a unique, exciting offer, you need to ask yourself, of all your offerings:
- Which can you most confidently deliver?
- Which do you enjoy delivering the most?
When it comes to buying decisions, the offer should be done with emotions and justified with logic afterward:
Offer – the product or service you are selling, which can include the following elements:
- Value – the problem that you will solve for your customer
- Language –  the words and jargon used by your target market
- Reason Why – the justification why you are doing this
- Value Stacking – the bonuses to help increase conversions
- Upsells – the complementary offerings to add value and increase profits
- Payment Plan – the division of an outstanding balance over time to increase sales
- Guarantee – the promise to your customer to take on the risk if you fail to deliver
- Scarcity – the fear of loss that gets your prospects to respond and buy immediately
Sell Through Copywriting
Next, you can master copywriting:
Copywriting – the skill of writing compelling words that convince prospects to take action and buy your products or services; has the following characteristics:
- Convey opinion, insight, advice, and commentary
- Embody your personality and authenticity to build rapport
- Appeal to the five motivators of human behavior: fear, love, greed, guilt, and pride
- Create headlines that grab the attention of your target market
- Tell prospects who your offer is not for to filter, establish credibility, and induce exclusivity 
Name Your Offer Or Business
To effectively name your product, service, or business, follow these rules:
- Title Should Equal Content: The name should clearly indicate the product, service, or business.
- Clarity Over Cleverness: Do not confuse or try to be witty, as you will lose prospects.

Chapter 3 – Reaching Prospects With Advertising Media


Instagram: @theprocesshacker
Advertising media is the vehicle to reach your target market and communicate your message.
Measure Your Marketing Spend
Marketing is expensive, so it can be managed using the following metrics or data points:
- Return on Investment (ROI) – measures the percentage of profit generated from a marketing campaign, relative to the marketing cost
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) – measures the total cost of marketing required to gain a customer
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) – measures the total value to a business of a customer over the entire relationship; divided between:
- Front End – the profit made on the initial sale; the goal is to turn prospects into customers
- Back End – the profit made on subsequent sales for the rest of the relationship
Peter Drucker has said, “What gets measured, gets managed,” so avoid spending on branding or “getting your name out there.”
Pick A Marketing Medium
There are many ways to get your message out there, including radio, TV, social media, search engine optimization (SEO), and email marketing. Avoid choosing only one medium for marketing, as this is a “single point of failure.” You should hire experts and buy services specifically for your chosen marketing medium:
Social Media – digital website or application that allows you to:
- Create and share content with the public quickly
- Build credibility, develop relationships, and engage with people
- Drive traffic to site/email list as you don’t own the audience and is not an ideal place to sell
Email Marketing – a direct, personal way to engage with prospects and customers that allows you to:
- Build a list of email subscribers to market and eventually sell to
- Provide value and self-promotion using personalized content and
- Maintain a close relationship with your customers, to which you can test and launch new offerings
Snail Mail – the postal mail, which complements email and allows you to:
- Send physical objects to induce emotion; for example, a handwritten card is more powerful than a text
- Send something that lasts longer and requires more effort to dispose of than email
- Stand out as it is much less cluttered than email marketing
Pay For Marketing And Don’t Budget
When you spend money on marketing, one of the following occurs:
- Failure: Your marketing expenses cost more than your sales revenue, so change or stop your actions.
- Unknown Result: You don’t know whether your marketing was successful, so track and measure your return on investment (ROI).
- Success: Your sales revenue is greater than your marketing expenses, so put more resources behind it.
Thus, you should avoid setting a marketing budget unless you are testing out different marketing tactics. Remember, paid marketing has two critical benefits:
- Reliability: Has a higher likeliness of being run when paid for.
- Measurability: Focuses you to track return marketing using metrics.

The “During” Phase
In the During Phase of the 1-Page Marketing Plan, the goal is to get the lead to buy from you for the first time. Leads are the people that know you and have indicated interest to your marketing message.
Chapter 4 – Capturing Leads


Instagram: @theprocesshacker
Capturing leads is the process of storing leads in a database system for future follow-up. 
Avoid Selling From Your Marketing
Don’t be desperate and sell directly from your advertising, as on average:
- 3% are ready to buy immediately
- 7% are very open to buying
- 30% are interested but not at the moment
- 60% are not interested
As most people will not be ready to buy, use your advertising to generate leads and increase your addressable market to 40%. 
Capture Leads In A CRM
Instead, you can correctly handle interest by capturing leads using a CRM system:
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system – a database that allows you to:
- Store lead information such as name and email
- Build value by providing content and information
- Establish yourself as an expert in your target market 
- Foster a relationship built on trust to sell to eventually
Focus On Higher Value Prospects
Don’t treat all prospects equally, as spending more on higher probability prospects will result in more conversations. Offer an “ethical bribe” to help you identify the high probability prospects.

Chapter 5 – Nurturing Leads


Instagram: @theprocesshacker
Nurturing leads is the process of guiding people from being vaguely interested in your offerings to wanting to do business with you. 
Follow-Up With Leads
The key to marketing is in following-up with your leads as:
- 50% of salespeople give up after one contact
- 65% give up after two contacts
- 80% five up after three contacts
Following up will build a strong relationship with your leads over. Be more compelling and prolific in your offers to gain more leads, make more sales, and grow more rapidly.
Create Your Marketing Infrastructure
Your marketing infrastructure will help your follow-up by interesting, motivating, and qualifying leads by:
- Staying in regular contact, so leads don’t forget about you
- Providing value using tutorials, articles, case studies, or a regular newsletter.
- Occasionally, pitching them your products or services.
Several assets make up your marketing infrastructure, including websites, newsletters, blogs, email sequences, social media, podcasts, hand-written notes, and more.
Each asset has a place and a purpose and should nurture leads. The author recommends using the following methods to provide outsized value and make a powerful impression:
- Lumpy Mail – an oversized piece of postage designed to grab attention
- Shock and Awe Package – a physical box to deliver goods, such as books, gifts, brochures, samples, etc.
Grow Your Marketing Team
You can’t do everything yourself, so you need to delegate properly. Thus, your business requires a team of the following three types of people to grow:
- Entrepreneur – the visionary that sees a problem and will solve that problem for profit
- Specialist – the implementer to take the entrepreneur’s vision and make it a reality
- Manager – the doer that gets work done and ensures gaining traction on the vision
In the Entrepreneurial Operating System, these business roles are divided into the Visionary (Entrepreneur) and Implementer (Specialist/Manager). Learn more about each role by reading our summary of Rocket Fuel. Or if you are just starting out as an entrepreneur, check out Entrepreneurial Leap (book summary) by Gino Wickman.
You need to create processes to consistently run your marketing activities:
- Marketing Calendar Activities – the scheduled marketing activities that occur daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually
- Event Triggering Marketing Activities – those marketing actions that occur in response to an event like receiving an email inquiry, gaining a subscriber, or receiving a complaint
For each marketing activity, you need to define the people who are responsible for each action.

Chapter 6 – Sales Conversion


Instagram: @theprocesshacker
Sales conversion is the process of building trust and providing value to motivate leads to buy your products or services.
Position To Make Money
Many people think that a better product or service will automatically cause people to buy from you and pay you more for it. However, the real profit comes from how you position yourself to charge higher prices for your goods and services. You want to be the welcomed guest that is familiar and brings value instead of the pest that bothers you and wants to take.
Manufacture Trust
You need to present your business and offerings in a way that conveys confidence and builds trust. Do not sell directly and instead educate, consult, and advise leads to the benefits of your products and services. 
Use the following technology to present your business professionally:
- Website: As this is the first place people learn about your business, make the site attractive. Also, include a phone number, physical business address, and privacy policy.
- Email Address: Use your own domain email instead of one from Hotmail, Gmail, etc. 
- Phone Number: Get a national toll-free number or toll-free word number.
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System: Manage customer details automatically and adequately.
- Ticketing System: This system can help you keep track of customer requests, inquiries, and support.
Price Strategically
You need to set prices properly to position the product or service using the following factors:
- Limit Options: Don’t give too many choices, so instead offer a “standard” version and “premium” version (priced at 50% above the “standard” but offers twice the value).
- Reverse Risk: Provide an “unlimited” version of your product or service for a fixed price.
- Offer an Ultra High-Ticket Item: Since a small percentage want to buy the “best” option, offer a unique, expensive product or service.
- Resist Discounting: Don’t discount, and instead increase the value of your offering by giving bonuses, more products, or extra services.
Remove Roadblocks That Prevent Sales 
There are several ways to remove obstacles that are preventing people from buying:
- Provide an Outstanding Guarantee: A guarantee allows you to remove the customer’s perceived risk if the product or service does not work out. Ordinary guarantees like “money-back guarantee” or “satisfaction guaranteed” are not very powerful.
- Have Them “Try Before Buying:” This method will make the lead feel like they are not committing to your offering. A genuine customer is unlikely to return the right product that meets their needs.
- Make Buying Easy: The sales process should be easy and painless by removing lengthy forms, providing multiple ways to pay, and offering payment plans.

The “After” Phase
In the After Phase of the 1-Page Marketing Plan, the goal is to get the customer to trust you and buy from you regularly and refer. Customers are the people that pay you money for your products or services. This cycle lasts indefinitely and can virtuously result in your customers continually buying your offerings.
Chapter 7 – Delivering A World Class Experience


Instagram: @theprocesshacker
A world-class experience has customers buying from you repeatedly and is implemented using systems.
Build A Tribe Of Raving Fans
To be successful, you need to turn your customers into a “tribe of raving fans:”
Tribe – a group of people connected to one another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea
Your tribe will want you to succeed and amplify your marketing message. For more on leadership, check out The 5 Levels of Leadership (book summary).
There are several characteristics of businesses that lead tribes:
- Influence your customers to take action to achieve results with your product or service
- Create theatre around their products and services in innovative ways
- Use technology to eliminate friction to provide a fast sale and increase satisfaction
- Provide value, position yourself as an expert, and maintain lifelong relationships
- Educate your audience on the effort required to deliver your product or service
Systematize Your Business
A system will make you successful and help grow your business:
Business System – uses document processes to allow your people to run your business without you
There are four central business systems that will make you successful:
- Marketing – the system that generates a consistent flow of leads into the business
- Sales – the system that nurtures, follow-ups, and converts leads
- Fulfillment – the that provides the product or service in exchange for payment
- Administration – the system that supports business functions and includes accounting, reception, human resources, etc.
Implementing business systems have the following benefits:
- Builds a Valuable Asset to provide cash flow to finance your lifestyle.
- Allows for Leverage and Scalability to serve more customers.
- Provides Consistency of products and services to customers.
- Lower Costs for labor and production as replicating improves efficiency.
- Remove Yourself to eliminate the biggest bottleneck in your business.
The business system is captured in an operations manual, which contains checklists, procedures, and training. There are three steps to capture processes:
- Identify all the positions in your business.
- Define the tasks that each role needs to perform. To learn more about structuring a business and defining roles, read our post on Accountability Charts.
- Document your process using checklists, which create a list of all tasks in a specific process. To learn more about checklists, read our post summarizing the book, The Checklist Manifesto.
Plan For Your Exit
When starting and running a business, you need to plan your exit strategy and sale to your ultimate customer:
Ultimate Customer – the person or company that puts you out of business
You can make a lot of money running a business, but you will make much more selling one. Documented systems will allow you to sell and pass on the company to someone else to run.

Chapter 8 – Increasing Customer Lifetime Value


Instagram: @theprocesshacker
Increasing the customer lifetime value of those who have already bought from you will result in higher profits. 
Make More Profit From Existing Customers
One is 21 times more likely to buy from a business they’ve purchased from in the past than one they’ve never bought from. Thus, your existing customer base is similar to a rich diamond mine that needs to be sold to more and more to realize its real value. There are five primary ways to make more money from existing customers:
Raising Prices – the act of increasing prices over time
- Don’t keep prices fixed as the value will decrease due to inflation
- Provide explanations of price raises to your customers
- Use “grandfathering” to hold prices constant only for existing customer
Upselling – the bundling of add-ons with the primary product or service being sold to provide an additional benefit
- Use the contrast principle as the suggested add-on fells comparatively cheaper
- Buyers are less price-sensitive to the add-on as they weren’t shopping for it 
Accession – the process of upgrading existing customers from their current product or service to a more expensive offering
- Prevent customers from switching to competitor’s product or service
- Don’t provide only one offer as you are leaving money on the table
- Provide your customers with something to aspire to
Frequency – the method of getting customers to buy more often using:
- Reminders: Send snail mail, email, or text to sell again or maintain the relationship 
- Reasons to Buy Again: Provide vouchers or coupons, so customers come back
- Reasons to Buy Repeatedly: Use the subscription model to make money automatically
Reactivation – the method of restarting the customer relationship by:
- Search your CRM database for a list of past customers you haven’t heard from
- Make a strong offer to get them to buy again (gift card, coupon, etc.)
- Contact past customers to ask why they haven’t repurchased from you
Manage Your Business Using Key Metrics
Data will help you manage and improve your business. Improving your key metrics by a small amount can have an outsized impact on the bottom line.
Key Marketing Metrics:
- Leads – the number of new leads that you capture
- Conversion Rate – the percentage of leads that you converted into paying customers
- Average Transaction Value – the average amount that leads spend with you
- Break-Even Point – the amount you need to earn in revenue to offset expenses
Key Subscription or Recurring Business Metrics:
- Monthly Recurring Revenue – the total recurring billing from your products or services
- Churn Rate – the percentage of recurring customers that cancel their subscriptions
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) – the total customer value to over the entire relationship
You can use a business dashboard or scorecard to track numbers, identify issues, and motivate your team. 
Identify Great Customers And Fire Problem Ones
There are four types of customers in your business:
- Tribe – the raving fans that promote your business, want you to succeed, and provide healthy revenue
- Churners – the customers that can’t afford you that leave and criticize your brand
- Vampires – the customers that can afford you, but you can’t afford them as they overwhelm and are difficult
- Snow Leopard – the rare customer that pays you considerably and is easy to work with
A formal way to categorize customers is using NPS:
Net Promoter Score (NPS) – measures customer loyalty and satisfaction in terms of promoters, detractors, or passives
Thus, all business revenue is not equal as some comes from toxic customers (churners, vampires, or detractors) that provide “polluted revenue.” Therefore, you should fire your problem customers free up your precious resources to focus on your high-value tribe.

Chapter 9 – Orchestrating And Stimulating Referrals


Instagram: @theprocesshacker
Instead of relying on word of mouth, you should be actively orchestrating and stimulating referrals. Many businesses rely on word of mouth, which puts the fate of other people’s hands.
Ask For Referrals
The “Law of 250” tells us that every person represents about 250 potential referrals, which is the number of important people in one’s life. Thus, you can ask and compel existing customers to give you referrals without seeming desperate using these strategies:
- Acknowledge them and appeal to their ego
- Not asking for a favor, but offering value to someone in their network
- Give them a reason why they should provide referrals
- Create an expectation of proving a specific number of referrals
Profit Through Joint Ventures
Your customers spend money with other businesses, so you can make deals with other companies through JCs:
Joint Venture (JC) – an agreement in which two or more businesses agree to pool their resources to accomplish a goal such as selling more together
These JCs can partner you with complimentary businesses to sell products and services together or become a cheap or free source of leads.
Monetize Your Existing Customer Base
Also, there are several ways to monetize your existing customer base: 
- Sell Leads with a complimentary business; however, ensure that you have permission to pass on customer details.
- Exchange Leads with a complimentary business instead of taking payment. Again, ensure that you have customer permission.
- Resell complementary products and services through wholesaling or white labeling and resell these to your customer base. This method ensures that you control your customer details.
- Become an affiliate referral partner, so that you get paid a commission on sales for each referral sent.
Build Your Brand
There are many definitions of a brand with Dib stating the following:
Brand – the personality of a business, which has the following attributes:
- Name and Design: How does it present itself?
- Positioning: How does it communicate?
- Brand Promise: What are its core values? What does it stand for?
- Target Market: Who does it associate with?
- Brand Awareness: How well-known is it?
Rather than getting someone to buy, branding should be done after a customer has purchased your product or service. Instead, you should create brand equity: 
Brand Equity – the goodwill you build up that compels people to do business with you over your competitor
Thus, focus on the sale and then turn your customers into a tribe of raving fans to work on branding.

### Sales Books 

#### 1. To sell is human

1. Non-Sales Selling: Almost all of our jobs now involve “moving others” in some way
2. Serve Others: Modern selling is not about pressure, but making other people’s lives better
3. Get In Tune: Great salespeople understand the buyer’s perspective by really listening
4. Stay Afloat: Every successful salesperson must swim over the “ocean of rejection”
5. Simplify Their Decision: Helping them think clearly about the problem, solution, and next step

1.      Non-sales selling (revised form of selling): the act of moving people to do something other than reach for their wallets – persuading, influencing and convincing others. Non-sales selling consumes the personal and work lives of most of the population: most of what we do is to ‘move’ (influence or persuade) others in a direction to vote, invest, pay attention, even date ect.
2.      The well-known ABC has changed: Pink suggests that the sales trade “Always Be Closing” has been replaced with “Attunement, Buoyancy, and Clarity.”
- Attunement is the ability to connect harmoniously with others by increasing your power by reducing it, using your head and heart equally and subtle mimicry.
- Buoyancy is the ability to stay afloat amid a sea of rejection and bad news.
- Clarity is a mindset which replaces traditional problem solving with problem finding and the ability to examine things in innovative ways. It can be achieved by the use of contrast – things are better understood when people see them in comparison with other things. The clarity to be a problem finder involves creativity and flexible thinking; effective salespeople brainstorm, problem find, offer insights, and help discover new opportunities.
3.      The era of predatory salesmanship and relentless pressure selling is over and no longer effective: the ability to shift your perspective, cultivate empathy and to understand the context from the other’s perspective have become superior qualities for the modern-day salesperson.
4.      Three important skills to develop to more effectively move others: pitch, improvise and serve. Modern pitch making includes 6 shorter alternative ways to influence others (see below 5.) Improvising forces sellers to listen deeply to align themselves on the spot with the customer – gone are the days of parrot fashion script-selling. According to Pink, the purpose of sales and non-sales selling is to serve others and make the world better.
5.      The traditional elevator pitch has been replaced by alternative ways to influence others:
- one-word pitch: make others think of the product/service when they hear one-word eg; when most people hear the word “search” they think of Google.
- question pitch: questions can be more powerful than statements in moving others.
- rhyming pitch: rhyming enhances the fluidity with which people make sense of things and studies show that people attribute greater accuracy to statements made in rhyme.
-  E-mail subject-line pitch: these are pleas for attention or invitations to engage. The sender’s relevance influences open rate and studies suggest people open more emails which offer usefulness or invoke curiosity. The more specific the language the better.
- Twitter pitch: winning tweets invite conversation in a few catchy lines.
-  Pixar pitch: influenced by the appeal of storytelling by Pixar Animation Studios, this pitch is a template of six sentences in narrative order. Once upon a time___. Every day___. One day___. Because of that___. Because of that___. Until finally___.
6.      Rising demand for the elasticity of skills: as the workforce has transformed, there is an increased demand for employees who possess skills-based elasticity: the ability to do many things, including sales. Gone are the days where each person did one specialised set of things in companies.
7.      Information Symmetry has changed the way traditional selling is conducted: In the past, the salespeople had all the knowledge and the consumer had very little. These days with the internet, the consumer has as much access to information and knowledge as any salesperson. No longer the gatekeepers of information, the power has shifted and the previous preconceived image people associate with the deceitful stereotypical salesmen has shifted. With equal access to information, there is less room for dishonest salespeople and more dealings are based on trust and transparency.
8.      The Ambivert Advantage: the most attuned and successful salespeople are a combination between extroverts and introverts – they are ambiverts. Ambiverts are neither too shy nor too outgoing and know when to engage others and when to hold back. 
To conclude, my key takeaway from Pink's To Sell is Human, is that rather than focusing on blatant selling and getting consumers to purchase a product/service, focus on moving them in a direction. How can you connect with them on their level, persuade, influence, convince and ultimately get them to move in a direction which will make their lives and the world a better place?

Here are few takeaways I formulated from his book To Sell is Human which I read a few years ago:
- Everyone is a sales person. In reference to my point above, no matter what position you own in an organization, you provide something you value in exchange for something else of value.
- You've heard of extroverts and you've heard of introverts, but what is an ambivert? A large percentage of the population is ambiverted - not too talkative and not too shy. An ambivert is a mix of the two extremes. Pink details some statistics in his book that show that ambiverts are in fact, the best salespeople. Using a scale of 1 to 7 where "1" is introvert and "7" is extrovert, typically the best salespeople fall in the 4 to 5 range.
- Perception E. This is a fun exercise. Hold your hand out in front of you and use your pointer finger as a pencil. Now draw a capital E on your forehead. Pink states you can tell a lot about a person's perception from this simple exercise. If you draw the E so people reading your forehead view it correctly and you read it backwards, you are more likely to be conscious of other people's perception. If you draw the E so you can read it correctly and it would read backwards to others, you are more likely to be inwardly focused with your perception.
- Blemishing Effect. This concept involves dropping a small negative detail in your sales pitch or sales proposal to emphasize the positives aspects. Due to the blemishing effect, the entire exchange will be rated more positively than if no negative details were mentioned at all.
- The Contrast Principle. Pink tells a story of two advertising executives walking through a New York City park. They come across a blind homeless person asking for money on a sign that reads "I am blind" who is holding a money cup. One executive makes a bet that he can make the homeless person more profitable by adding four, and only four words to his sign. The other ad executive takes the bet. The sign is changed to read "It is springtime and I am blind." Adding this simple detail makes those walking by understand the contrast in what they are seeing during a routine spring day that may be taken for granted versus what the homeless person cannot see. Needless to say, the four simple words filled his cup much faster and he won the bet.

1) Selling well means making things better for your customer.
It isn't about "making the sale" anymore -- it's about finding a solution for someone that will help them long-term. Pink writes, "To sell well is to convince someone else to part with resources -- not to deprive that person, but to leave them better off in the end." Carefully listen to the specific needs and goals of a buyer in order to connect them with a solution that will improve their situation. 
2) Traditional salespeople are obsolete.
According to Pink, todays’ technologies have flattened organizations and made traditional salespeople irrelevant. Consider that patients often come into their doctors' offices already having researched all of their symptoms and possible treatments. Because most people will ask their questions to Google before ever picking up the phone and calling a salesperson, in order to stay relevant in sales, you need to share helpful information that goes beyond product features. Think business insights and expertise.
3) Salespeople must move from being protectors of information to content curators and clarifiers.
Buyers can go out and find most of the information they need before making purchases. So instead of being sources of information, salespeople must transform themselves into information curators and disseminators. Salespeople need to help their prospect remove all of the noise vying for their attention (and there's a lot of it), and focus on what is most relevant for their situation. Stay on top of industry trends and competitive news to help buyers identify the best and most important solutions to solve their challenges (or bring to their attention challenges they didn't even know they had).
4) "Buyer beware" is now "seller beware." 
Pink writes that the sales environment has shifted from "caveat emptor" (buyer beware) to "caveat venditor" (seller beware). In the past, it was very hard for buyers to determine if a seller was being honest. After all, the salesperson was their sole source of information -- without the internet, corroborating claims or performing independent research was difficult. But today, the reality is much closer to "caveat venditor." Buyers have easy access to a wealth of information, and can easily sniff out a shoddy seller or product. This is why it is so important to find solutions with an eye to your buyer's benefit -- snake oil sellers need not apply. If you can truly help your customers, they will repay you with positive reviews and could even turn into a promoter for your product or service.
5) ABC doesn't mean "Always Be Closing."
In order to be effective within the buying ecosystem today, you need to be able to practice Pink’s new version of "ABC:"
- 		Attunement: The ability to empathize with or bring your outlook into harmony with other people.
- 		Buoyancy: “The combination of a gritty spirit and sunny outlook,” according to Pink.
- 		Clarity: The capacity to help others see their situation in new ways and identify problems they didn’t know they had. 
6) Service selling is the future of sales.
The new ABCs of selling align closely with Pinks’ observation that “the time is ripe to move towards service selling.” What does service selling mean? It's when salespeople focus on serving their customers better (upserving) as opposed to selling them more (upselling). If you can find more ways to help your customer be more successful, the dollars will flow. If you can continually solve for the customer, you will be in a prime position to flourish in sales.


The Book in Three Sentences
- We’re all in sales.
- Ambiverts are the most effective salespeople
- It’s easier to sell something to someone when you know doing so will improve their life — and maybe even the world.


The Five Big Ideas
- “Like it or not, we’re all in sales now”.
- “The ability to move others to exchange what they have for what we have is crucial to our survival and our happiness”.
- “Adam Grant has discovered that the most effective salespeople are ambiverts, those who fall somewhere in the middle of the introversion-extraversion scale”.
- “The most effective self-talk doesn’t merely shift emotions. It shifts linguistic categories. It moves from making statements to asking questions”.
- “Anytime you’re tempted to upsell someone else, stop what you’re doing and upserve instead. Don’t try to increase what they can do for you. Elevate what you can do for them”.


The three key steps to strategic mimicry:
- Watch. Observe what the other person is doing.
- Wait. Once you’ve observed, don’t spring immediately into action. Don’t do this too many times, though.
- Wane. After you’ve mimicked a little, try to be less conscious of what you’re doing.
- “Attuning yourself to others—exiting your own perspective and entering theirs—is essential to moving others”.
- “Adam Grant has discovered that the most effective salespeople are ambiverts, those who fall somewhere in the middle of the introversion-extraversion scale”.
- “How to stay afloat amid that ocean of rejection is the second essential quality in moving others. I call this quality ‘buoyancy’”.

strategic mimicry


Interrogative Self-Talk
- “The most effective self-talk doesn’t merely shift emotions. It shifts linguistic categories. It moves from making statements to asking questions”.
- “On average, the self-questioning group solved nearly 50 percent more puzzles than the self-affirming group”. (Senay, Albarracín and Noguchi, 2010)
-  “People who’d written Will I solved nearly twice as many anagrams as those who’d written I will, Will, or I”.
- “[Interrogative self-talk], by its very form, elicits answers—and within those answers are strategies for actually carrying out the task”.
- “Researchers say, ‘[interrogative self-talk] may inspire thoughts about autonomous or intrinsically motivated reasons to pursue a goal’”.
- “People are more likely to act, and to perform well, when the motivations come from intrinsic choices rather than from extrinsic pressures”.
- “Declarative self-talk risks bypassing one’s motivations. Questioning self-talk elicits the reasons for doing something and reminds people that many of those reasons come from within”.
- “Those who’d heard the positive-inflected pitch were twice as likely to accept the deal as those who’d heard the negative one—even though the terms were identical”.
Explanatory Style
- “In human beings, Seligman observed, learned helplessness was usually a function of people’s ‘explanatory style’—their habit of explaining negative events to themselves”.
- “People who give up easily, who become helpless even in situations where they actually can do something, explain bad events as permanent, pervasive, and personal”.
- “Agents who scored in the optimistic half of explanatory style sold 37% more insurance than agents scoring in the pessimistic half. Agents in the top decile sold 88% more insurance than those in the bottom decile”.
- “The salespeople with an optimistic explanatory style—who saw rejections as temporary rather than permanent, specific rather than universal, and external rather than personal—sold more insurance and survived in their jobs much longer”.
- “[Hall] is not blind optimism but what Seligman calls ‘flexible optimism—optimism with its eyes open’”.
- Question: “Can I move these people?”
- “Answer it—directly and in writing. List five specific reasons why the answer to your question is yes. These reasons will remind you of the strategies that you’ll need to be effective on the task, providing a sturdier and more substantive grounding than mere affirmation”.
“When something bad occurs, ask yourself three questions—and come up with an intelligent way to answer each one “no”:
- Is this permanent?
- Is this pervasive?
- Is this personal?
- “The more you explain bad events as temporary, specific, and external, the more likely you are to persist even in the face of adversity”.
Enumerate and Embrace
- “One way to remain buoyant is to acquire a more realistic sense of what can actually sink you. You can do that by counting your rejections—and then celebrating them. It’s a strategy I call ‘enumerate and embrace’”.
- Enumerate. “Try actually counting the nos you get during a week. By the end of the week, you might be surprised by just how many nos the world has delivered to your doorstep. However, you might be more surprised by something else: You’re still around. Even in that weeklong ocean of rejection, you’ve still managed to stay afloat. That realization can give you the will to continue and the confidence to do even better the following week”.
- Embrace. “’It was my way of showing that I didn’t quit’, [Goldbery] says. ‘I got all these rejections, but kept going’”.
- “Allow yourself what [Fredrickson] dubs ‘appropriate negativity’—moments of anger, hostility, disgust, and resentment that serve a productive purpose”.
- “[Fredrickson’s] work has shown that thinking through gloom-and-doom scenarios and mentally preparing for the very worst that can occur helps some people effectively manage their anxieties”.
Rejection
- “If this approach sounds useful, present yourself with a series of ‘What ifs?’ What if everything goes wrong? What if the unthinkable happens? What if this is the worst decision of my life? These questions could prompt answers you didn’t expect, which might calm you down and even lift you up”.
- “One way to reduce their sting [of rejection], and perhaps even avoid one altogether, is to preempt the rejecter by writing [a rejection] letter yourself.
- “Once the rejection is in writing, its consequences can seem far less dire”.
- “More important, by articulating the reasons for turning you down, the letter might reveal soft spots in what you’re presenting, which you can then work to strengthen”.
Saving
- “Three in four Americans have less than $30,000 saved in their retirement accounts”.
- “Our biases point us toward the present. So when given a choice between an immediate reward (say, $1,000 right now) and a reward we have to wait for ($1,150 in two years), we’ll often take the former even when it’s in our own interest to choose the latter”.
- “Those who saw images of their current selves (call them the ‘Me Now’ group) directed an average of $80 into the retirement account. Those who saw images of their future selves (the ‘Me Later’ group) allocated more than twice that amount—$172”.
- “Those who saw the image of themselves at age seventy saved more than those who’d simply seen a picture of a seventy-year-old”. (Hereshfield)
- “The problem we have saving for retirement, these studies showed, isn’t only our meager ability to weigh present rewards against future ones. It is also the connection—or rather, the disconnection—between our present and future selves”.
- “Envisioning ourselves far into the future is extremely difficult—so difficult, in fact, that we often think of that future self as an entirely different person”.
- “This conceptual shift demonstrates the third quality necessary in moving others today: clarity—the capacity to help others see their situations in fresh and more revealing ways and to identify problems they didn’t realize they had”.
Problem Finding
- “The ability to move others hinges less on problem solving than on problem finding”.
- “As Csikszentmihalyi saw it, the first group was trying to solve a problem: How can I produce a good drawing? The second was trying to find a problem: What good drawing can I produce?”
- “When he tabulated the ratings, Csikszentmihalyi discovered that the experts deemed the problem finders’ works far more creative than the problem solvers’”.
- “In subsequent research, [Csikszentmihalyi] and other scholars found that people most disposed to creative breakthroughs in art, science, or any endeavor tend to be problem finders”.
- “You can raise that question by framing your offering in ways that contrast with its alternatives and therefore clarify its virtues”.
The following five frames can be useful in providing clarity to those you hope to move.
1. The Less Frame
- “Of the consumers who visited the booth with twenty-four varieties, only 3 percent bought jam. At the booth with a more limited selection, 30 percent made a purchase”.
- “Adding an inexpensive item to a product offering can lead to a decline in consumers’ willingness to pay.”
- “Framing people’s options in a way that restricts their choices can help them see those choices more clearly instead of overwhelming them”.
2. The Experience Frame
- “Several researchers have shown that people derive much greater satisfaction from purchasing experiences than they do from purchasing goods”.
- “Even when people ponder their future purchases, they expect that experiences will leave them more satisfied than physical goods”.
- “Framing a sale in experiential terms is more likely to lead to satisfied customers and repeat business”.
3. The Label Frame
- “In the Wall Street Game, 33 percent of participants cooperated and went free. But in the Community Game, 66 percent reached that mutually beneficial result”.
- “The neatest group by far was the first—the one that had been labeled ‘neat’”.
- “Merely assigning that positive label—helping the students frame themselves in comparison with others—elevated their behavior”.
4. The Blemished Frame
- “Remarkably, in many cases, the people who’d gotten that small dose of negative information were more likely to purchase the boots than those who’d received the exclusively positive information”.
- “The researchers dubbed this phenomenon the ‘blemishing effect’—where ‘adding a minor negative detail in an otherwise positive description of a target can give that description a more positive impact’”.
- “But the blemishing effect seems to operate only under two circumstances. First, the people processing the information must be in what the researchers call a ‘low effort’ state. That is, instead of focusing resolutely on the decision, they’re proceeding with a little less effort—perhaps because they’re busy or distracted. Second, the negative information must follow the positive information, not the reverse. Once again, the comparison creates clarity. ‘The core logic is that when individuals encounter weak negative information after already having received positive information, the weak negative information ironically highlights or increases the salience of the positive information”.
- “If you’re making your case to someone who’s not intently weighing every single word, list all the positives—but do add a mild negative. Being honest about the existence of a small blemish can enhance your offering’s true beauty”.
5. The Potential Frame
- “Participants, on average, gave the veteran player with solid numbers a salary of over four million dollars for his sixth year. But they said that for the rookie’s sixth season, they’d expect to pay him more than five million dollars”.
- “People often find potential more interesting than accomplishment because it’s more uncertain, the researchers argue”.
- “Next time you’re selling yourself, don’t fixate only on what you achieved yesterday. Also, emphasize the promise of what you could accomplish tomorrow”.
Off-Ramps
- “Once you’ve found the problem and the proper frame, you have one more step. You need to give people an off-ramp”.
- “Among the students in the least likely group who received the less detailed letter, a whopping 0 percent contributed to the food drive. But their counterparts, who were more disposed to giving but who’d received the same letter, didn’t exactly wow researchers with their benevolence. Only 8 percent of them made a food donation”.
- “However, the letter that gave students details on how to act had a huge effect. Twenty-five percent of students deemed least likely to contribute actually made a contribution when they received the letter with a concrete appeal, a map, and a location for donating”.
- “A specific request accompanied by a clear way to get it done ended up with the least likely group donating food at three times the rate of the most likely who hadn’t been given a clear path of action”.
- “Clarity on how to think without clarity on how to act can leave people unmoved”.
Motivational Interviewing
- “On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 meaning ‘not the least bit ready’ and 10 meaning ‘totally ready,’ how ready are you to study?”
- “Why didn’t you pick a lower number?”
- “In the old days, our challenge was accessing information. These days, our challenge is curating it”.
The three-step process for curation (Kanter):
- Seek. Once you’ve defined the area in which you’d like to curate, put together a list of the best sources of information. Then set aside time to scan those sources regularly (at least fifteen minutes, two times a day). As you scan, gather the most interesting items.
- Sense. Creating meaning out of the material you’ve assembled. Make an annotated list of Web links or regularly maintain a blog. Tend to this list of resources every day.
- Share. You can do this through a regular e-mail or your own newsletter, or by using Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. As you share, you’ll help others see their own situations in a new light and possibly reveal hidden problems that you can solve.
- “The folks at IDEO, the award-winning innovation, and design firm, have taken a lesson from the under-five set in one of the methods they use to find design problems. They call their technique ‘Five Whys’”.
- “As IDEO explains it, ‘This exercise forces people to examine and express the underlying reasons for their behavior and attitudes’”.
- “The purpose of a pitch isn’t necessarily to move others immediately to adopt your idea. The purpose is to offer something so compelling that it begins a conversation, brings the other person in as a participant, and eventually arrives at an outcome that appeals to both of you”.
Dan Pink’s six successors to the elevator pitch:
1. The One-Word Pitch
- “The ultimate pitch for an era of short attention spans begins with a single word—and doesn’t go any further”.
2. The Question Pitch
- “By making people work just a little harder, question pitches prompt people to come up with their own reasons for agreeing (or not). And when people summon their own reasons for believing something, they endorse the belief more strongly and become more likely to act on it”.
3. The Rhyming Pitch
- “Participants rated the aphorisms in the left column as far more accurate than those in the right column, even though each pair says essentially the same thing. Yet when the researchers asked people, ‘In your opinion, do aphorisms that rhyme describe human behavior more accurately than those that do not rhyme? the overwhelming answer was no”.
- “Rhymes boost what linguists and cognitive scientists call ‘processing fluency’, the ease with which our minds slice, dice, and make sense of stimuli”.
- “If you’re one of a series of freelancers invited to make a presentation before a big potential client, including a rhyme can enhance the processing fluency of your listeners, allowing your message to stick in their minds when they compare you and your competitors”.
4. The Subject-Line Pitch
- “The researchers discovered that participants based their decisions on two factors: utility and curiosity”.
- People were quite likely to “read emails that directly affected their work”. But they were also likely “to open messages when they had moderate levels of uncertainty about the contents, i.e. they were ‘curious’ what the messages were about”.
- “Utility worked better when recipients had lots of e-mail, but ‘curiosity [drove] attention to email under conditions of low demand’”.
- “Ample research has shown that trying to add intrinsic motives on top of extrinsic ones often backfires”.
- “Along with utility and curiosity is a third principle: specificity”.
5. The Twitter Pitch
- “The mark of an effective tweet, like the mark of any effective pitch, is that it engages recipients and encourages them to take the conversation further—by responding, clicking a link, or sharing the tweet with others”.
6. The Pixar Pitch
After someone hears your pitch, ask yourself:
- What do you want them to know?
- What do you want them to feel?
- What do you want them to do?
“In those circumstances and many others, you’ll do better if you follow three essential rules of improvisational theater: (1) Hear offers. (2) Say ‘Yes and’. (3) Make your partner look good”.
1. Hear Offers.
- “Once we listen in this new, more intimate way, we begin hearing things we might have missed. And if we listen this way during our efforts to move others, we quickly realize that what seem outwardly like objections are often offers in disguise”.
2. Say “Yes and”.
- “Instead of swirling downward into frustration, ‘Yes and’ spirals upward toward possibility. When you stop you’ve got a set of options, not a sense of futility”.
3. Make Your Partner Look Good.
- “Today, if you make people look bad, they can tell the world. But if you make people look good, they can also tell the world”.
- “But Grant and Hofmann reveal something equally crucial: ‘Our findings suggest that health and safety messages should focus not on the self, but rather on the target group that is perceived as most vulnerable’”.
- “Raising the salience of purpose is one of the most potent—and most overlooked—methods of moving others”.
- “While we often assume that human beings are motivated mainly by self-interest, a stack of research has shown that all of us also do things for what social scientists call ‘prosocial’ or ‘self-transcending’ reasons. That means that not only should we ourselves be serving, but we should also be tapping others’ innate desire to serve. Making it personal works better when we also make it purposeful”.
- “Merely discussing purpose in one realm (car-sharing) moved people to behave differently in a second realm (recycling)”.
Serving Others
- “This is what it means to serve: improving another’s life and, in turn, improving the world”.
- Greenleaf on “servant leadership”: “The best test, and the most difficult to administer, is this: Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?”
- “If the person you’re selling to agrees to buy, will his or her life improve? When your interaction is over, will the world be a better place than when you began?”
- “Upserving means doing more for the other person than he expects or you initially intended, taking the extra steps that transform a mundane interaction into a memorable experience”.
- “Anytime you’re tempted to upsell someone else, stop what you’re doing and upserve instead. Don’t try to increase what they can do for you. Elevate what you can do for them”.

#### 2. Sales acceleration formula


There are five key elements that go into the sales acceleration formula. 
- The Sales Hiring Formula – Hire the same successful salesperson every time.
- The Sales Training Formula – Train every salesperson in the same manner.
- The Sales Management Formula – Hold salespeople accountable to the same sales process.
- The Demand Generation Formula – Provide salespeople with the same quality and quantity of leads every month.
- Technology – Leverage technology to enable better buying for customers and faster selling for salespeople.





Inbound marketing is a business methodology that attracts customers by creating valuable content and experiences tailored to them.

Technology
The last piece of the puzzle is technology, where Roberge suggests using tools to better equip your salespeople for success. 
This is something we’ve covered in detail in the Chili Piper ultimate guide to sales acceleration, but here’s a quick refresher of some specific tools that are helpful:
- Lead scoring
- Lead routing
- Marketing automation software
- Real-time alerts
- Email tracking
- Predictive analytics 
I find that lead scoring is especially helpful because it provides you with quantitative data based on specific actions, like viewing a pricing page or watching a demo, that can be used to prioritize leads. 




Building a Metrics-Driven Sales Culture

What’s the sales acceleration formula?
It “provides a scalable, predictable approach to growing revenue and building a winning sales team.”

20+ Content Marketing Statistics, and What They Mean for You
Editor's Note: This post was originally published on Oct, 2016 and has been updated with new statistics and insights.
Content still matters deeply to B2B business. In fact:
A Regalix 2016 survey found 96% of marketers identifying content marketing as a core part of their strategy.
But what is the landscape of content marketing like today? And are the rules changing? Moreover, how can marketers keep up with content production, to appeal to the needs of their audiences? And specifically: What kinds of content are supreme today, and which metrics are becoming important?
In this article, we will answer all those questions. Content marketing statistics give an insight into the content strategies of other B2B companies. So you should often compare strategies to know how you measure up to industry standards.
A CMO's Guide to B2B Lead Generation [Free eBook PDF]
Furthermore, each statistic here includes a takeaway that marketers should use to improve their B2B marketing strategy in 2017 and beyond.
Content Marketing Statistics: Is Content Still Effective?
Just consider this statistic:

Content is still an effective tool to engage buyers for B2B business. Buyers are still happy reading, watching, and consuming content from brands they follow and trust.
But unlike content several years ago, the goals of content are changing:
The top three B2B goals of content marketing include: Lead Generation (85%); Sales (84%); Lead Nurturing (78%). (Content Marketing Institute)
Therefore, B2B marketers are using content for more than just engagement and thought leadership. Content is staking its claim as a lead generation, conversion, even sales tool. and marketers will use content to grow their business outcomes this year.
But to do this successfully, they must be fluent in matching content to a buyer’s journey.
Only then can marketers understand how buyers move down the sales funnel — and utilize content to nurture and guide them along the way.
Content Marketing Statistics: Top Content Priorities
Marketers' first priority is growing SEO/organic presence, according to Hubspot’s State of Inbound 2016 report. Yet blog content creation is a close second priority, with content distribution and amplification rounding out the top three.


 Image source: Hubspot

On the subject of blogs, they're still the bread and butter for many B2B marketing strategies:
 “60% of marketers focus on blogs in their work.” — State of Inbound 2016
Also, blogs were the most commonly produced content marketing type worldwide in a September 2016 report from Conductor:


 Data source: Conductor

And although some formats are still tried and true, the sheer amount of content continues to increase YOY:
70% of B2B marketers plan to create more content in 2017 compared to 2016 (Content Marketing Institute).
But with all that content to keep up with, who is responsible for creating it? We'll explore that next.

Content Marketing Statistics: Content Creators
Content creation remains an in-house responsibility at a majority of marketers. In fact, the number of Hubspot respondents identifying staff as their content writers jumped from 41% in 2015 to 71% in 2016.
Participation levels across the board — including executives, freelancers, guest posters and agency posters — were higher this year. And Hubspot took this as an indication of continued investment in creating blog content:


 Image source: Hubspot

Next, the question becomes, are marketing teams effective at managing their content needs? Not quite:
Only 30% of B2B marketers in the Content Marketing Institute (CMI) and MarketingProf’s 2016 report said their organizations were effective at content marketing, compared to 28% in 2015.
Despite the increased value of content, marketing teams do not feel more effective with their plans.
But thankfully, simple strategies seem to have a large effect on the top-performing B2B companies:
According to the CMI report, effectiveness was greater among respondents who:
- Documented an editorial mission and content marketing strategy
- Communicated frequently with their team
- Had clarity about what success looked like
Clarity is hard to come by for many B2B marketers:


 Image source: CMI

But a marketing and sales alignment can help achieve organization clarity for your content plan.
Content Marketing Statistics: Promotional Channels & Formats
Now, how are marketers promoting their content?
Many marketers are experimenting with new content channels, Hubspot found.
For B2B marketers, 48% planned on incorporating YouTube, 39% were looking to add Facebook video, and 33% identified Instagram as the channel they’d add to the marketing mix in the next 12 months.
These top three channels were identified as the top choices to leverage in marketing efforts internationally, although messaging apps came a close fourth in Latin America and Southeast Asia.
According to a report by Experian and MarketingCharts, Facebook and Youtube are clearly the dominant channels:

Although, with an updated layout for content, LinkedIn is increasingly important as well:
94% of B2B marketers use LinkedIn as part of their content strategy (Content Marketing Institute).
With its entirely new layout comes new best LinkedIn practices for marketers. B2B marketers should switch their company pages over to the new format immediately to begin testing strategies.

And then comes the question of mobile vs. web content:
Regalix study indicates that marketers overlook mobile content. In fact, only 11% of respondents reported an exclusive mobile content strategy — a drop from 21% who focused on mobile in 2015.


 Image source: Regalix

Content Marketing Statistics: Opportunities
When seeking out new opportunities, content marketers might want to revisit their existing content marketing strategies before getting too excited about new channels.
In a survey of more than 400 B2B content marketers, Conductor found only 2 out of 5 marketers target their content. According to Ann Handley, a MarketingProfs content wiz, “Useful x Inspiration x Empathy = Effective Content.”
But segmented audiences aren't yet widespread for B2B — despite the effectiveness of targeted content.
Further, only 26% of B2B marketers gather competitive insight. Yet analyzing the competition’s content marketing strategy can help enhance your own efforts: At least 36% of the marketers recognize this, and check on the competition monthly or more often.
“If you’re not doing any type of competitive analysis, it’s likely that your content marketing strategy isn’t as great as it could be.” — Larry Kim, WordStream
As for another opportunity: In April 2016, Harris polled more than 2,000 Americans on their familiarity with content marketing. Some 46% of overall respondents had never heard of content marketing:


 Image source: HarrisPoll

Nevertheless, the generational differences loomed large here with 65% of millennials stating they were familiar with content marketing compared to 53% of Gen Xers, 49% of Baby Boomers and 37% of Mature respondents.
So the question for savvy marketers become: How can you use content marketing to entice whole new segments of buyers, of which content isn't currently common?
Just because your industry doesn't currently have content abundance, doesn't mean it won't be an effective lead generation tool.
Content Marketing Statistics: Content Analytics & Metrics
Next, how are marketers measuring their content — and which metrics matter?
The majority of B2B marketers plan to create more content in 2017, but that doesn’t mean it is good content. To stand out, B2B marketers must constantly analyze their content in order to produce better and better pieces.
78% of B2B marketers use ‘website traffic’ to determine how well its content marketing is producing results (Content Marketing Institute).
Website traffic is a useless metric because it does not tell your company anything. Just because a blog post received a lot of clicks, that doesn’t mean it converted actual customers. Marketers should focus on other metrics such as conversions through the funnel and qualified leads to see how well content performs.

In the end, good content will grab top spots on search engines. But the most important thing for B2B business is conversions from content. And marketers must use content analytics to figure out what contributes to conversions, such as:
- CTA conversion rate
- Number of social shares
- Word count and form of top-performing posts
Then, B2B marketers must replicate strategies that work.
Still, judging content marketing ROI remains a challenge. Regalix found website traffic (64%) and conversion rates (63%) were the primary metrics marketers used in evaluating their content marketing success. CMI’s respondents, though, pointed to sales lead quality (87%), sales (84%) and higher conversion rates (82%) as their top metrics to measure success.
Content Marketing Statistics: Content Technology
Marketers should continuously expand their knowledge-base in order to stay valued team members. Marketing technologies that help measure, track, and manage campaigns are on the rise:
70% of survey respondents said they expect their marketing technology budget to increase slightly (50%) or greatly (20%) in 2017 (Walker Sands).
So marketers should consider free training programs from Hubspot to improve their skill sets.
As the internet becomes a more crowded space for marketing, content marketing remains a primary strategy to boost a brand, grow traffic and reach more potential customers.
B2B Content Marketing is Changing
Marketers are called upon more and more to calculate an ROI on their efforts, which means B2B marketing must shift to a more analytical approach.
B2B marketers that rely on metrics such as website traffic, bounce backs, or even clicks per post will find it hard to lead a successful campaign.
Though B2B marketing can be more traditional than B2C strategies, it’s important to embrace marketing technologies that can help produce better results. There are even free (or trial-based) tools that B2B marketers can use to run more analytical campaigns.
Marketers who can provide hard data on their efforts will thrive in the new B2B marketing landscape, so becoming familiar and comfortable with analytics and data in 2017 and beyond is key.

Hire salespeople with skill sets that complement your selling situation
Sales reps should be trained thoroughly in their customer’s job
Defined and measurable agreements help sales and marketing get along
Leveraging sales technologies improves efficiency and effectiveness of sales reps

In Part I, Mark uncovers what he found to be characteristics of a successful salesperson at Hubspot.
Their traits were:
- Coachability
- Curiosity
- Prior Success
- Intelligence
- Work Ethic

Here are some of my takeaways from Part II:
- Having new sales hires shadow a top performer is not a scalable or predictable solution.
- There are three aspects of a well-designed sales methodology: The buyer journey, the sales process and the qualifying matrix.
- “The sales process supports the customer along his buying journey.”
- BANT is old school but is a decent place to start.
- Once you have a sales methodology in place, developing a training curriculum is straightforward.
- As the sales team grows, have top salespeople teach training classes (especially if it falls into their core strength).
- Add exams and certifications to sales training criteria.
- The sales training formula needs to be constantly evolving. It must react to changes in the business.
- Sales training scores can be an even better predictor of success than the sales hiring scores.
- “The best-trained salespeople have experienced the day-to-day job of their potential customers.”
- “Once the salesperson truly understands the day-to-day job of the buyer, the salesperson can then effectively relate to the buyer.” (Feel the customers’ pain!)
- Social media presents an opportunity for salespeople to be regarded as trusted advisors by their buyers.
- Bloggers love comments.
- Salespeople should allocate their time to social media participation.

Management Formula

As such, here are my takeaways from Part III:
- High performance sales managers identify the one skill that will have the biggest impact on a salesperson’s performance and then customize a plan around developing it.
- Metrics-driven coaching.
- Role playing and recording sales calls are two solid coaching tactics.
- Why does the prospect need our solution today? What will be the implications if they don’t buy today? Six months from now, if the problems we solve are not solved, what happens then?
- Peeling back the onion is key in metrics-driven coaching.
- “How can we use deeper metrics to peel back the onion and properly diagnose the skill deficiency?”
- “The sales compensation plan drives the results of the business.” (Agreed)
- Ideally, sales comp plans should be simple, aligned, and immediate.
- Create a Salesperson Promotion Tier (Agreed).
- Promotion tiers are great for company culture.
- Sales contests are great for short-term, focused goals.
- Sales contest updates should be sent daily.
- Monthly sales contests are ideal.
- Do not overlap sales contests.
- Sales leadership candidates have a well-rounded grasp of the entire sales methodology.
- Leadership potential is demonstrated via a person’s contributions to the team.
- “Managers need to teach salespeople how to get themselves out of trouble and stay productive without too much hand-holding.”
- Pick a deficiency in a salesperson’s process, coach them on it, then check in the next day. If the salesperson does not apply the coaching, that is a red flag. It’s probably best for both parties to part ways.


The Demand Generation Formula

Other takeaways included:
- Google does factor social media influence into its rankings (did not know that).
- Have your sales team participate in social media discussions where your prospects are.
- Consider hiring a journalist to join your startup as a content creator.
- Use each salesperson’s “Sent” folder as a blog source. Look for canned email replies to common questions (clever).
- As a rule of thumb: 1/3 of social media message about your company and 2/3 about other people.
- The Long tail can often be more valuable that the head (The Area Under the Curve).
- Buyer Persona/Buyer Journey Matrix.
- The going negative voicemail has the higheset callback rate.
- PCR is also championed, just under a different term: Put Marketing on a revenue quota.
- A lead that is called within minutes vs hours or days converts to a customer at exponentially higher rates (agreed!)
- 5 followup calls for SMB; 8 for mid-market; 12 for enterprise.
- “Do Not Be on It” dashboard.

Technology and Experimentation

My biggest takeaways from Part V were:
- In order to get a dashboard and reports that sales managers love, most sales tech creates extra work for frontline salespeople.
- “Great teams have a core philosophy of continual improvement.”
- We should be driving home a culture of doing experiments.
- Have top performers run experiments so that you can uncover true negatives.

True Negative (TN):
A true positive is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the positive class. Similarly, a true negative is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the negative class. A false positive is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class.

- Overview
- The goal: “Scalable, predictable revenue growth.”
- “Hire the same successful salesperson every time.” (The Sales Hiring Formula)
- “Train every salesperson in the same way.” (The Sales Training Formula)
- “Hold our salespeople accountable to the same sales process.” (The Sales Management Formula)
- “Provide our salespeople with the same quality and quantity of leads every month.” (The Demand Generation Formula)
- These four components represented my formula for sales acceleration. If I could execute on these four elements, I believed I would achieve my mission of “scalable, predictable revenue growth.” For each of these components, I devised a repeatable process, leaned into metrics, and ran calculations, making each of these tactics formulaic in nature.
- When the unique strengths of the salesperson align with the company’s sales context, it is a beautiful thing.
- The ideal sales hiring formula is different for every company…but the process to engineer the formula is the same.
- Step 1: Establish a Theory of the Ideal Sales Characteristics
- Step 2: Define an Evaluation Strategy for Each Characteristic
- Step 3: Score Candidates against the Ideal Sales Characteristics
- Step 4: Learn and Iterate on the Model while Engineering the Sales Hiring Formula
- There were five traits that correlated most significantly with sales success. Coachability Curiosity Prior success Intelligence Work ethic
- Intelligence: the ability to learn complex concepts quickly and communicate those concepts in an easy-to-understand manner.
- Don’t hire a recruiting agency. Don’t build a corporate recruiting team. Build a recruiting agency within your corporation.
- “The most critical value from your first sales hire comes not from the first customers or revenue she generates, but from her ability to accelerate the company toward product/market fit.”
- Defining the Three Elements of the Sales Methodology: The Buyer Journey, Sales Process, and Qualifying Matrix
- The buyer journey represents the general steps through which a company progresses as it purchases a product. Once the buyer journey is defined, the sales process can be created. The sales process supports the customer along his buying journey.
- A very common qualifying matrix that has been used for many decades is BANT. BANT stands for “Budget, Authority, Need, and Timing.”
- “Exams and certifications add predictability to the sales training formula. They also provide the platform to learn from and iterate on the formula.”
- The other advantage of having this structure in place was the establishment of a baseline foundation from which to measure and iterate. The sales training formula needs to be constantly evolving, reacting to changes in the business, just like the sales hiring formula.
- In this new buyer/seller paradigm, salespeople must prove their worth by adding more value to the process. Sales is no longer about memorizing the call script, the price book, and the top 10 objections. It’s about being a genuine consultant and trusted advisor to potential customers. Modern selling feels less like a seller/buyer relationship and more like a doctor/patient relationship.
- The best-trained salespeople have experienced the day-to-day job of their potential customers. In the first few years of HubSpot, we targeted marketing professionals. Therefore, my sales training goal was to teach our new sales hires what it was like to be a marketer. New sales hires did not spend their first few weeks in sales training, memorizing scripts and discussing objections. Instead, our new sales hires spent their first few weeks at HubSpot developing their own website, writing their own blog, and creating their own social media presence.
- Touching the Medium
- “A common sales management mistake is to overwhelm the salesperson with coaching too many skills simultaneously. Pick one skill and focus.”
- As we’d walk through their plans for each salesperson, I’d ask them three questions: What skill will you work on this month with this salesperson? How did you decide on that skill? What is the customized coaching plan you will use to develop the skill?
- I needed to keep customer churn in check. I also needed the salespeople to be able to control their own destiny. I asked myself, “What criterion is 100 percent in the control of the salesperson and highly correlated with customer success?” For the HubSpot business at the time, the answer was advanced payment terms for new customers. Our customers who paid month-to-month were less committed to the overall HubSpot service and were far more likely to churn. Those who prepaid annually were more committed to the service and were ultimately more successful. As a result, Plan 3 was designed as follows: Salespeople would earn $2 per $1 of monthly recurring revenue The commission would be paid out as follows: 50 percent on the first month’s payment 25 percent on the sixth month’s payment 25 percent on the twelfth month’s payment Under this plan, if a customer signed up paying month-to-month, the salesperson would need to wait an entire year to earn the full commission from that customer. If the customer signed up paying a year in advance, the salesperson would earn the entire commission immediately. The plan was well aligned with how far in advance the customer paid. How far in advance a customer paid was correlated with high customer success and completely in control of the salesperson. Evaluate a sales compensation design through the lens of three factors: Simple. Aligned. Immediate.
- Incentives
- “Sales contests are an effective tool to drive short-term behaviors and build team culture within the sales organization.”
- The statement certainly has merit. Of all the professional functions within an organization (e.g., marketing, product, finance, HR, and so forth), sales has the largest variance between the general characteristics that are conducive to success on the front line and the general characteristics that are conducive to success in the management ranks. Sometimes really good salespeople are selfish, egotistical, and competitive by nature. Those traits do not translate well into management.
- Flip the Demand Generation Formula—Get Buyers to Find You. “How much are you spending on inbound marketing, such as SEO, social media participation, and blogging?” Here are the two simple actions you need to take in order to drive inbound links and social media following: Create quality content (e.g., blogs, ebooks, webinars) on a frequent basis. Participate in the social media discussions in which your target prospects are already conversing.
- So how does long-tail theory apply to your business? As you embark on a content product process, focus on the “long tail,” not on the “head,” especially when selecting target topics. If you sell IT services, don’t focus on phrases like “IT consultant” or “information technology.” These words sit at the head of the curve. Yes, there are millions of searches per month. However, it is extraordinarily competitive to rank for these terms. Furthermore, a small portion of the visitors are actually qualified buyers for your business. Instead, focus on “Sharepoint implementations” or “IT for pharmaceutical companies” or “hosted VOIP implementations.” There are not millions of searches for these terms every month. However, there are still hundreds of them, and the people searching for these terms are much more qualified for your business than those folks searching for the generic, far more competitive phrases. Each piece of content you produce targets a different slice of the long tail. Each piece of content attracts hundreds of highly qualified buyers to your business. The more you publish content along this strategy, the larger the portion of the long tail you can own. As we stated earlier, the long tail can often be more valuable than the head.
- Here are the most common mistakes and the most important best practices marketing needs to adopt as they work with sales to convert interest into revenue. The Most Common Mistake: Don’t Pass All the Leads to Sales. The first step in establishing the Marketing SLA was to define when a lead would be qualified to be passed to the Sales team. The decision to pass a lead to Sales is best derived from the Buyer Matrix.
- Which type of lead do you think closed at a higher rate—the product collateral download or the active free trial? The active free trial closed at a higher rate, of course! This type of lead was further along in the buyer journey. It was at the “Solution Selection” stage of the buyer journey, rather than the “Solution Research” stage. In our case, active free trials closed at many times the rate of product collateral downloads.
- Sales technology creates better buying experiences for customers by capturing customer context and making that context readily available to salespeople.


#### 3. Predictable revenue

Getting Started 
In the book, Aaron Ross says that to create predictable revenue, you need to do 3 things 
- Predictable lead generation – It includes identifying leads you wish to target and keep track of the conversions
- A dedicated sales development team – It should connect the marketing and sales teams.
- Consistent sales systems – Having well-documented systems enables all the salespeople to stick to the same process without any confusion. 

Cold Calling 2.0



The authors define cold calling in the book as calling a person who doesn’t know you and is not expecting a call from your end. Most often, it is not a pleasant experience for the caller and the receiver. 
Conventional cold calling is not alive anymore, as the calls usually reach the wrong individuals. . According to Ross, the main problem with cold calling is that you spend too much time searching for the right person to talk to instead of qualifying them or closing a deal with them. 
The authors name their prospecting strategy as Cold Calling 2.0. 
Cold Calling 2.0 is reaching out to the email accounts of people without making use of cold calls. While getting in touch initially, you shouldn’t talk about the sale at all. Attempting to sell can ruin the conversion rate of the emails. 
Cold Calling 2.0 is a complex process. You can reach out to contacts and request them to direct you to the deciding authority in the organization. This would be rather easy for the contact and in return, you would get to make better connections with decision-makers. 
Ideally, prospecting is the most challenging part of the sales funnel. Cold Calling 2.0 involves processes and systems for predictable lead generation. -You can predict the results you might get by putting in a certain amount of effort. 
The authors suggest that the primary step to build a predictable revenue and help the company grow is to generate high-quality leads steadily. 
There will be a non-stop flow of new customers only when there is a consistent flow of qualified leads in the sales pipeline. 

How To Prospect, As Per Cold Calling 2.0? 
1. Ideal customer profile– Firstly, you must have a clear ICP. Have clarity over the companies or industries you wish to sell to and the job posts of the decision-makers of those companies. 
2. Build a list– You have to build your contact list with contacts that match the ICP you created.
3. Email campaigns– One of the essential parts of Cold Calling 2.0 is to know how you can effectively use outbound emails. It is better to ask prospects to direct you to the right person in your emails. Then, it would seem more like a referral email and not a cold email.
4. Sell the Dream– The book says that you must assist prospects in painting a picture of what they require to resolve their problem and how your product can help them. As a sales rep, identify if the prospect is the perfect fit. Once that is done, focus on the prospects, instead of selling what you have to offer. 
5. Pass the Baton– You can forward the potential customer to the next stage. It involves passing the baton to the account executive to proceed further. 

Build Your Team
As per the authors, there is a need for specialized professionals to get the best results. The best salespeople with the maximum experience can handle activities having low-volume and high-value like building relationships. The rest of the roles should be handed to those who are not specialized and can handle tasks of lower value and high volume like prospecting cold companies.
The 3 chief roles of salespeople are:
Qualifiers:
These are the professionals who get in contact with the lead, are actively prospecting, or are the ones that give the first response to the leads generated. They qualify leads and send them to the closers. The opportunities generated each day are a way of measuring them.
Closers:
These are the professionals responsible for effectively selling and closing customers after the qualifiers pass them. There is a revenue goal for each closer, and the ideal way of measuring them is by converting opportunities into revenue for the organization.
Farmers:  
These professionals are the customer success and account managers who take care of client deployment, expanding the customer account and account renewals. They keep the customers happy. 
The chances of killing one’s productivity are higher when there is a mix of different responsibilities for one person. The inefficiencies are the following:
1. Difficult to keep track of important metrics
2. Difficulty in finding out the problem 
3. Reduction in the focus of salespeople due to overload of responsibilities
4. Harder to make salespeople expert in their area
5. Expensive

The Right Time To Specialize



According to the authors, you can do specialization even with a handful of professionals in your sales team. You need just two people to get started with specialization. Ross says that you can use the 80/20 rule. When a rep spends more than 205 of their time working on a secondary function, you must turn that into a new role. 
The Onion Layers
Ross compares the stages of the sales process that enables you to build a relationship with prospects with the layers of an onion. That’s how you lead the prospect into becoming a customer with lots of patience. You need the practice to take baby steps. You have to let the prospect decide when and how to move forward. 

The Types Of Leads
So, what does the book say about a lead? A lead is a prospect who has some interest in what you are offering and responds positively. It can be signing up for a free trial or providing their details on the website. 
As per the book, there are three types of leads: Seeds, Nets, and Spears.
Seeds: Seeds are the leads you get through an organic internet search of SEO, local user groups, and social media. Cultivating and nurturing such leads is time-consuming, but they have the highest conversion and close rates to offer. 
Nets: Nets are the types of leads generated using traditional marketing programs that target a large audience.
Spears: These are leads generated through targeted outbound efforts like cold calling 2.0, business development. Generating such leads requires some effort from the sales team. 

Inbound Marketing Methods
To generate leads mode efficiently and nurture existing leads, you can use some marketing methods like the following:
1. Referrals – Referrals are the most effective marketing method. They work well regardless of being online or offline.
2. Free trial tools – There can be free downloadable resources, free product trials, or free training videos. 
3. Organic Search – This happens with good quality content and SEO. 
4. Blog – To build a direct link with the reader, blogs are the best. You can share content relevant to your business to grab the attention of prospects. 
5. Email marketing – It is a popular marketing technique to generate new leads and nurture exciting ones. You can give updates to the prospects and promote your product or service. It is also possible to share blog posts and invite prospects to events. 
6. Webinars – Using sales webinars, you can engage the prospect by providing helpful information and build trust in your brand.
7. Affiliate Marketing – You can partner with bloggers and promote your product or service to reach a new audience. The pay is on a pay-per-lead or percentage-of-revenue basis.  
8. Social media – Social media is a great platform to promote your product or service, making your business have an online presence and adding a personal touch to it. 

The Greatest Bottleneck
Ross says that at Salesforce, they found that the biggest hitch in prospecting was not selling to the decision-maker but finding one. 
Usually, the decision-maker is not the person you have spoken to, and it becomes important to win over the people in the client company. It would be best if you also had advocates to help you get into the organization. If your prospects have the buying process in their hands, you can use ways to accelerate it. 

The 3-Hour-And-15-Minute Sales Process
The recipe for creating a sales princess is easy. 
You must spend 15 minutes qualifying or disqualifying an opportunity and one hour to find out who the key individuals are and the decision process is. Then you can take 2 hours to explain how your company can help the prospect company overcome its challenges. 
Using this duration of time, you have to ask yourself some questions,
An essential question to ask is ‘why’. The salespeople who have experience know how to use this question well. There are times when the prospects are not aware of their challenges and the main root cause of their problems. Well-experienced salespeople help prospects identify their problems and offer solutions to resolve them. Asking questions beginning with a ‘why’ helps find the correct answers and move ahead with the selling process. 

Make Prospects Earn Proposals
As per Ross, you are too easy as a salesperson if you are not winning a minimum of 50 percent of your making proposals. When you give out proposals too soon and too easily, the prospect will not value you, and you might end up losing the lead. Allow the prospect to earn the proposal to do that, don’t give it to them until they want you to do so. 


Leadership
For a business to earn predictable revenue, it is essential to change the mindset of executives. CEOs and VPs make the mistake of not staying abreast of the times and not understanding how lead generation works.
They need to study and understand what the role of specialization is. The executives also have to educate themselves on how they should hire, train, retain and encourage their business teams. 
Here is the piece of advice from Aaron Ross to help out executives,
More than the product, focus on the customer: Executives should spend 25 percent of their time with customers and find out how their product or service impacts the customers.
Follow up from time to time: Select 3-5 sales indicators and follow up regularly week by week.
Have your focus on after-sales: Be available for the customer even after closing the deal. It matters a lot. 

Hiring And Developing Good Sellers
As a sales manager, you have to treat the sales team just like how you treat customers. You have to hire capable, organized individuals who possess excellent learning power in your team. You have to build trust and get the input of the team on decisions most often. Ask for their feedback and make sure that they succeed. If you put the effort into making the team grow, the salespeople will work for the success of you and the company. 
Treat the sales team just the way you would treat your customers. 

Key Takeaways Of Predictable Revenue
As you have seen in the Predictable Revenue summary, the book gives insight to lead generation, sales systems and earning predictable revenue. Here are the main takeaways,
1. To create predictable revenue, you must carry out lead generation. 
2. You need a sales development team that creates a bridge between the marketing and sales team. 
3. There is a need for a consistent sales system because you cannot have predictability when there is no consistency.
4. You should have an outbound prospecting team that generates leads from cold companies and qualifies them before sending them to the sales team.
5. The process is scalable when the CEO and executives are not a part of the process.
6. When emailing high-level executives, you must ask for a referral to the right person in the company for the initial conversation.
7. Have a clear ICP or Ideal Customer Profile. Find how you describe ICPs and what their problems are.
8. Upon setting up a phone call, you have to stay focused on the prospect business and not start selling our offering.
9. You cannot create predictable revenue when you don’t have a predictable pipeline, and it requires measuring and tracking the creation of the pipeline. 
10. Obsess over the process of decision-making and not the decision-maker.

Repeatable Lead Generation: The First Step to Effective Sales
The book proposes that the fundamental step to building predictable revenue – to achieve consistent, year-after-year growth – is to steadily generate high-quality leads.
Only when there’s a consistent flow of qualified leads into your pipeline – will you have a constant flow of new customers that’ll help create predictable revenue.
A ‘Lead’ is a prospect that has responded positively or shown some interest in your offering, such as signing up for a free-trial or filling up a form on the website, etc.
The book categorizes leads into three types: Seeds, Nets, and Spears.
- Seeds: Seeds are the leads you find through channels like organic internet search/SEO, local user groups, social media or publishing expert content. Although it takes some time to cultivate and nurture these leads, they’re unbeatable with the highest conversion and close rates.
- Nets: Nets are the leads generated through classic marketing programs targeted at a large audience.
- Spears: Spears are the leads generated through targeted outbound efforts such as business development, Cold Calling 2.0, etc. Generating these leads requires some individual human efforts.
Specialized Sales Roles to Focus on Prospecting
Salespeople typically handle three activities: prospecting, qualifying, and closing. These are three distinct responsibilities and require different skill sets to be successful.
It is unreasonable to expect your salespeople to switch between different mindsets throughout the day and still consistently generate new business.
For these very reasons, the authors recommend splitting your sales team into three different categories:
- Sales Development team: This team is solely focused on prospecting. The only mission of this team is to create new, qualified opportunities from cold (ones you didn’t know at which you didn’t have a previous relationship) or inactive accounts and passing them to a quota-carrying salesperson to close.
- Market Response Team: This team is focused on qualifying inbound leads. The only motive of this team is to qualify marketing leads coming through website or word-of-mouth programs and assign qualified opportunities to the appropriate quota-carrying salesperson.
- Account Executives: Account Executives are the quota-carrying salespeople that focus on closing the qualified opportunities passed over to them. Account Executives don’t spend their time on prospecting activities. Rather they focus on higher-potential sources of business such as a small targeted list of strategic accounts, developing referrals, current customer base, etc.
Creating dedicated sales teams for different activities will ensure your salespeople work on what they do best. This will dramatically improve their productivity and make a significant impact on revenue generation.
On the whole, the idea is to:
- 		Focus your Account Executives on low volume but high-value activities, such as building relationships at key accounts.
- 		Specialize your sales reps to take over low-value yet high-volume activities such as prospecting into cold accounts.
Cold Calling 2.0
Cold Calling 2.0 is an outbound sales methodology that involves prospecting into cold accounts to generate new business – without using any cold calls.
The purpose of this framework is to have a process in place that’ll help generate new pipeline and leads predictably – that is, if an organization puts in “x efforts”, they should know it will lead to “y results”.
Unlike the traditional cold calling technique, Cold Calling 2.0 is different in the following ways:
a. No cold calling
Instead of using cold calling to get in touch with prospects, the framework recommends sending cold emails to generate referrals to the decision-makers first, who then are likely to expect your call.
b. A focus on results, not activities
Once you generate referrals through cold emails, you can set up a “qualification call” with these prospects trying to learn if there’s a mutual fit.
Tracking these metrics such as qualification calls made per day, qualified opportunities generated per month, etc – unlike metrics like calls/dials made per day in Cold Calling 1.0 – will help you set more realistic goals about your pipeline.
c. Everything is process-driven
Cold Calling 2.0 lays great emphasis on repeatability and consistency in management practices, hiring, training, etc.
This leads to a predictable pipeline and the entire team’s results become sustainable.

Executing Cold Calling 2.0
The formula is simple. Outbound sales prospecting helps generate predictable leads. And predictable lead generation leads to predictable revenue.
Once you have a dedicated role/team for outbound prospecting – whose only job is to generate qualified opportunities for your quota-carrying Account Executives, here’s the five-step framework you should follow:


Step 1: Build Your Ideal Customer Profile
Understand who your Ideal Customer is – who they are, what are their core challenges, red flags/deal-breakers if any and even ideal contacts to get in touch with.
Having a clear-cut definition of your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) helps you quickly:
- 		Find great prospects through smart targeting.
- 		Disqualify poor prospects.
a. Smart Targeting: Define 3-5 criteria of your Ideal Customer.

b. Decode their core challenges: Figure out the core challenges of the companies and individuals in the buying process. Ask them questions like:
- 		What are your biggest challenges?
- 		What are your main frustrations?
- 		What’s most important to you?
- 		Where do you spend your money?
c. Red Flags/Deal Breakers: Keep an eye out for signals that warn you against working together or indicate a potential bad fit such as budget constraints, history, recent investments, geography, etc.
Step 2: Build Your List
The next step of this framework focuses on building your own list of targeted prospects. Do you have decision-makers or lower-level people?
Are you targeting companies/people based on your ICP? Or are you randomly cluttering your list with irrelevant prospects?
Randomly throwing in prospects that don’t fit your customer criteria will only clutter your database and waste your time eventually – it’s better to keep away from such practices.
Also, try using prospecting tools to make your job more effective and maybe – a little easier. Experiment with tools to identify what works best for you.
Different prospecting tools suit different businesses, pick one that suits your business best.
Step 3: Run Outbound Email Campaigns
Running cold email campaigns is the step that gets you in front of new prospects.
The framework insists on starting with cold emails for outreach and then using calls to follow-up with people that respond.
a. Start Small:
Start by sending 50-100 prospecting emails every few days a week as an outreach campaign. Send no more than 150-250 outbound emails per week, over a course of 3-4 days.
Your goal should be to generate around 5-10 responses per day – roughly about a 10% response rate. More than that gets difficult to manage.
b. Market Segmentation:
To make your emails look targeted, divide your target prospects based on some common characteristics such as business model (B2B, B2C, agency), revenue, contact title, demographics, how they learned about you, etc.
Market Segmentation will help your emails look like they’re a single email craft specifically for a prospect from a salesperson.
Moreover, it helps you reach out with the most suitable messaging for individual prospects – so that it best resonates with them – and compel them to take action.
c. Writing your Emails:
The idea of these emails is to start a conversation. Here are a few basic guidelines:
- 		Keep your mails short. Be honest and to the point – why are you reaching out?
- 		The mail should be text-based – no fancy HTML.
- 		Optimize your emails for the smartphone. Make it easy to read and respond.
- 		Offer credibility (give examples of customers)
- 		Ask one simple-to-answer question in the end (such as for a referral).
d. Campaign Guidelines:
- 		Don’t aim for getting more than 5-10 responses per day – else, they’re likely to slip through the cracks.
- 		You’re bound to get a lot of bounces from newly built or purchased lists – make sure to exclude these email addresses from your database regularly.
- 		It’s vital to log every single response that you get into a sales automation software. This will keep you organized and ensure that no responses fall through the cracks.
- 		Tracking engagement metrics like opens, clicks, etc provide insights about your most interested prospects and prioritize accordingly.
e. When you get a response:
- 		The goal of every email that you send should be to move the prospect one step further to the close.
- 		To move things further, you can ask either of these two questions in your mail: Who is the best point of contact for …? (to get a referral) or when is the best day/time for a quick discussion around ..?” (to set up a conversation with the prospect)
- 		For getting a referral, the idea is to confirm the best point of contact for a first conversation and get referred to them. You can then email the new contact while mentioning the person that referred you.
- 		For the second goal, the objective is to set up a quick call to see if there’s a mutual fit between your company and your prospect’s company. These calls are called scoping or prospecting calls. The purpose of these calls is to get your prospect talking. Ask them some open-ended questions and encourage them to talk about their business.
- 		If someone tells you that they’re not interested, figure out why. Find out if the “no” is coming from an objection that you can handle. Make sure you clearly convey your value proposition.
- 		Also, understand that a “no” doesn’t matter unless it is coming from a key decision-maker.
- 		Old Opportunities Campaign: Train your new salespeople to generate new opportunities by reaching back to old opportunities that have died or become inactive for more than 6 months.
Step 4: Sell the Dream
In this part, the book suggests helping your prospects paint a picture of:
- 		The solutions they need to solve their problems.
- 		Connect your product to their key business issues and explain how it can help them.
The book emphasizes that sales reps should take time to determine if there’s actually a fit by seeing if they’re connected to the right people (decision-makers) if their prospects are serious about taking action and are willing to take the next step.
Once a sales rep determines that a prospect is a good fit, the next task is to stay focused on the prospect’s business – and not yours.
Here are a few questions that’ll help you gather information straight from the horse’s mouth. Ask any 3-4 questions:
- 		How are your “x” teams/functions organized?
- 		What systems do these teams use for marketing and lead generation?
- 		How long has the system been in place?
- 		Why did you buy the old system? Who decided to purchase it?
- 		What are your challenges now? (Keep asking “what else” after each answer)
- 		Have you been looking at alternatives yet?
- 		Have you tried and failed with other solutions? Why?
Few more important tips:
- 		Always call a person below the C-Suite first to understand how their business works and what their current challenges are.
- 		Ask straight about their pain-points, in case if it isn’t obvious after your conversation.
- 		Keep digging deep until you get a complete picture of their challenges and pain-points.
- 		Always work to schedule your next step while you’re still on the phone.
Step 5: Pass the Baton
The final stage of Cold Calling 2.0 is all about passing a qualified opportunity to the Account Executive and having him to re-qualify the opportunity.
Guidelines for an SDR to handoff the opportunity to an Account Executive (AE):
An SDR should consider passing on the opportunity only when:
- The prospective company fits their Ideal Client Profile (ICP)
- If he’s gotten in touch with the decision-maker.
- If the prospect shows a clear interest in going forward. For example, taking a discovery call with an Account Executive.
Once an opportunity fits this bill, the SDR can pass it over to the Account Executive.
The Account Executive then gets on to a call with the prospect and requalifies him against the same criteria – to check if the opportunity was rightly qualified by the SDR.
The SDR is compensated when the Account Executive approves the opportunities passed on to him.
Audit Process for quality checking purposes
Aaron highlights the need for having the manager to do a quality check on the opportunities generated once in a while.
Here are a few guidelines for the audit process:
- 		Was the opportunity truly an incremental, outbound opportunity?
- 		Was the opportunity truly re-qualified by the Account Executive?
- 		Did the SDR and the Account Executive consistently log all the data into the sales automation software? Or did they miss out on any data?
Sales Best Practices to Help Reps Strengthen their Approach
The authors suggest a “3-Hour-and-15-Minute” sales process to help sales reps quickly qualify an opportunity in the initial stages of a sales cycle.
This structure helps qualify or disqualify an opportunity early, gain access to multiple decision-makers and help create a vision for the prospect.
Here’s the three-step framework:
Step 1: First Contact – 15 minutes
The book emphasizes on not taking more than 15 minutes of your prospects time to figure out if you make it for a good fit.
Set expectations, layout a process so that both of you can figure out if there’s a mutual fit and position it in a way that benefits them.
For example,
- 		An in-depth discovery call with all the people likely to be involved in the sale.
- 		A follow-up call with all the key people team on the team to flesh out how and when to work together.
Step 2: Qualification/Discovery Call – One hour
If you think there’s a fit, create a plan with the prospect to organize a working session that brings in their key decision-makers to meet and create a vision with your key decision-makers.
The more confident you are about this layout process and why works it for them, the more likely your prospect is to follow along.
Step 3: Group Working Session – Two hours
Time to implement the plan here. Once you bring in both the parties together, create a joint vision as to how your prospect will be successful with your product.
Coach the vision out of them, rather than just telling them how it works.
How to Build a Good Sales Team?
The authors think that the best way to build a great sales team is to grow and develop your own.
They advise using role-playing to train people on calls, demos, and presentations.
Here’s how you can do that:
- 		Create a scenario and describe it to the group.
- 		Select a trainee.
- 		Other people can pretend to be holding different roles at the prospect company.
- 		Send off the person to be trained, back to their cube, or another room
- 		Everyone else goes to the conference room to listen in.
- 		Trainee dials into the conference room and begins.
The book suggests one self-managing training meeting once every week. It consists of a mix of topics in 10-15 min chunks, such as:
- 		Product or sales training.
- 		General business topics such as how to manage people or understanding financial statements.
- 		Public speaking skills for reps to present to the whole team and get feedback
- 		Any random fun topic to discuss.
How to Become the Best Sales Manager?
Aaron advocates that an outstanding Sales Manager will be capable of the following responsibilities:
1. Choose people carefully: It’s always better to hire for talent and adaptability than for experience. A fast-learning, hungry hire can make up for a reasonable lack of experience in 6-12 months.
2. Set expectations and vision: The book endorses defining a role in terms of results – not in activities.
He stresses on the importance of laying out a flexible process to help your team achieve results – giving them advice and guidance but allowing them to find their way.
3. Remove Obstacles: The authors suggest creating a frictionless environment for your sales team by setting clear rules of engagement, compensation plans, and sales processes – so that no time and energy are utilized for maximum benefit.
4. Inspire your people: Understand what helps your team to excel and to achieve their full potential.
Good compensation structure, regular compliments on good work, opportunities for career advancement or achieving particular goals helps keep the motivation.
5. Work for your people: Take time to understand your individual salesperson’s life/career goals, then work to help them achieve those goals.
The more you work for your team’s success, the more willing they will be to work for your success.
6. Improve it next time: Aaron suggests periodically going back to these five steps, reflecting on how well they’re working for you and improving them as your company grows.
A Framework to Improve your Sales Organization
Here are three steps that the book commends to improve your sales organization:
1. Include salespeople while planning new programs: It’s vital to make your sales team feel like they’re a part of the decision-making process.
Make your sales team feel included by voicing their opinions about your sales culture. Ask them regularly for feedback and ideas – how’d they want to manage the sales organization, any changes they’d like to make, etc.
2. Gather feedback about new sales programs: Whenever you’re drafting a new program or rule, make sure to regularly gather feedback from your sales team.
This will help catch any bugs or issues early – before it is released to everyone.
3. Survey satisfaction: Get to know how satisfied your team is with the environment and the support they get. The parts they find frustrating etc.
This tells them that you’re genuinely concerned about their well-being and will raise their morale and engagement – leading to more productive results.

Critical Summary
90% of businesses fail because they can't get anyone to buy, yet for all the books available to entrepreneurs on pitching, product development, and persistence – there are few great resources that a show you how to acquire customers systematically.
Predictable Revenue is that book, as far as outbound sales is concerned. Predictable Revenue is not a book about cold-call opening lines or sales psychology. Rather, it is a book that teaches you how to create a systematic sales process that's disciplined and rigorous.
I read this book after feeling lost trying to design an optimal outbound sales for my B2B software business, and the book addressed most of my questions. There are certain implementation details which are not covered such as what your cold email content should be, or what follow-ups to send, or how to get fully up and running with sales automation software. Luckily there are a lot of up-to-date resources online to fill these gaps.
The book is repetitive at times, repeating topics in different chapters, but months after reading this book, I'm happy about it because it helped engrain key points.
Here were some of my key takeaways:
- Outreach to start conversations with the appropriate people and identify opportunities should be its own dedicated work stream, separate from the process of nurturing and closing deals.
- A key part of having an efficient sales process is knowing and being systematic about which people/accounts to NOT spend time on (lead qualification).
- As a corollary, being targeted by defining and working off of a Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is critical.
- Generating predictable revenue takes time and trial-and-error.
- Use voicemails as a tool to increase response rates from emails rather than to attempt to get people to call you back
- Obsess about the decision making process, not the decision maker
- Prospects should earn proposals (get something in return)

Intro
The biggest impact / lowest hanging fruit for generating predictable revenue is creating an outbound sales development team that focuses 100% on prospecting.

The shift from organic growth (getting customers through founders and hustling) to proactive growth based on investing in programs that generate predictable growth requires new habits, practices, and systems, causing a lot of delays and frustrations. The shift does not happen overnight and can take months or in many cases years.
Adding salespeople and working them harder != more revenue. For companies selling products worth less than $100K - $250K, more "feet on the street" fails more often than not. You need great salespeople to close customers, but the better your lead generation is, the less dependent you are on the quality of your salespeople and sales process.
Most salespeople won't generate enough leads on their own... they're terrible at prospecting, hate to prospect, and as soon as they do generate some pipeline, they become too busy to prospect.
It can take 2-12+ months to get lead generation cranking and generating predictable revenue. What works:
- trial-and-error in lead generation
- "marketing through teaching" via regular webinars, white papers, email newsletters, live events to establish yourself as the trusted expert in your space
- patience in building great word of mouth
- cold calling 2.0
- building an excited partner ecosystem (very high value, very long time to results)
- PR (its great when it, once in awhile, generate actual results)
Ensure awareness and focus on your team:
- Does your executive team and board know how much new (qualified) pipeline the company needs to generate per month?
- Is the "new pipeline generated per month" number tracked at the board level?
- Common definitions for "prospects", "leads", and "opportunities"
Cold Calling 2.0
Cold calling 2.0 = prospecting into cold accounts to generate new business without using any "cold calls". "Cold call" = calling someone who doesn't know you and who isn't expecting your call. No one enjoys this – neither the caller nor the person being called. Buyers are sick of being sold to and become more resistant every year to classic sales and marketing methods.
Cold Calling 2.0 works if your customers are worth more than $5,000 (otherwise its harder to make it profitable).
Breakthroughs that led to "cold calling 2.0":
- Realization that most of the time cold calling was spent hunting for the right person to talk to
- Mass emailing c-level fortune 5000 executives with specific kinds of emails generated 9%+ response rates
- Sending emails to high level executives to ask for referrals to the best person in their organization for a first conversation lead to great results
Roles
- "Sales Development Representative" / Outbound Sales rep - Focused on Cold Calling 2.0 and just generating outbound leads
- Account Executive - a quota carrying salesperson
- Market Response Rep - inside salesperson who only qualifies leads coming in from a website
Account Executives should not make cold calls because 1) they don't like to do it, 2) they usually aren't any good at it, 3) it's a poor use of company resources by using the most expensive sales role to do lower-value work.
Account Executives should prospect:
- A short, targeted "Top 10" list of strategic accounts to penetrate
- Their current customer base
- Developing referral or channel partners

Executing Cold Calling 2.0
Before you begin, you should have:
- At least one person 100% dedicated to prospecting (even if they're part-time).
- A proven product or service that has generated revenue.
- CLTV > $10,000. The process will work if your LTV is lower (especially if you're a single-owner business), but it becomes more challenging to make it profitable through hired salespeople.
Specialize
Implement Sales Development to prospect for new clients and generate qualified leads, and Market Response to qualify inbound leads. Having one team do both significantly drops productivity.
One Sales Development Rep can typically support 2 - 5 Account Executives.
For every 400 leads per month that require human attention, a company needs one Market Response Representative. Removing unqualified opportunities out of the pipeline early increases focus.

Measuring time...
Ramp-up time: Time it takes for a new SDR to ramp up
Prospecting cycle length: time from a) prospect first responding to a campaign to b) when a qualified opportunity is created or re-qualified by the Account Executive
Rule of thumb: 2 - 4 weeks
Sales cycle length: time from a) opportunity being created or qualified to b) when it was closed
1. Define your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

Make note of red flags and deal breakers... eg. "They just installed a _____ kind of system"
Also define ideal buyers/partners, eg. "Our ideal contact is a VP Sales who is new to their role (less than 90 days in) who is looking to make things happen. They are process-oriented, report to the CEO, and love data and reports. Their challenges include not being able to give accurate reports to their CEO because of problems with their sales system or the data in it..."
Limit yourself to 1 - 5 types of profiles.
Reinforce and validate profiles by learning and asking...
- What are your greatest challenges?
- What keeps you up at night?
- What do you spend money on?
- What are your main frustrations?
2. Build lists
...
3. Run outbound email campaigns
Aim for sending 150-250 outbound emails per week (50-100 per day), over the course of 3-4 days with a goal of having 5-10 responses per day (10% resposne rate, excluding bounces). Getting more responses than this will lead to prospects falling through the cracks.
Limit to 3 contacts per account.
Guidelines for emails:
- Send before 9am or after 5pm, avoid Mondays and Fridays.
- Look as if they are a single email that came from a salesperson (text-based)
- State simply and clearly why you are reaching out
- Offer credibility
- Ask just one simple-to-answer question (such as for a referral)
- Capture/log all responses.
Use voicemails as a tool to increase response rates from emails rather than to attempt to get people to call you back. (pg. 69)
The goal of every email should be to establish and close a prospect on a next step. The next step should be EITHER:
- Who is the best point of contact for...? (get a referral)
- When is the best day/time for a quick discussion around...? (set up a conversation with the prospect)
For #1, when you obtain the right contact, you can email the new contact directly while mentioning or cc'ing the individual who referred you. Internal referrals create the highest likelihood of getting a response.
For #2, setting up a call, the objective is to set up a quick time to see if there's a high-level fit between your company and the prospect's company. This call should be focused entirely on their business – not your business. Lead the conversation and ask open questions that encourage them to talk about their business.
"No" doesn't matter until you hear it from the CEO or ideal decision maker. Even then, when you get a No, you should figure out why to determine if its an objection you can handle. Oftentimes prospects misunderstand what you do or what value you offer.
If someones opened your email more than once, call them.
4. Determine mutual fit and interest
Be hard on determining if there's a good fit. It is better to pass fewer, better opportunities to your Account Executives.
Once a prospector connects by phone with a prospect to find out if there's mutual fit, the biggest challenge is staying focused on the prospect's business and not selling yours. Ask open-ended questions about their business first before moving on to ask about challenges.
Ask 3 - 4 questions like:
- How are your __ teams/function organized?
- How does our __ process work today?
- What systems do these teams use for __?
- What are your challenges now?
- Have you been looking at alternatives yet?
- Have you tried and failed with other solutions? Why?
- Where does __ fall on your priority list? What is higher?
- What would an ideal solution look like to you?
- How will your decision-making process work?
- Why did you buy the old system? Who made the decision to purchase it?
- What is the probability a project will occur this year [in the next six months]?
- Why do it now? (Or why wait until later?)
Typical call flow:
- Opening "Did I catch you at a bad time?" and introduction
- Discuss prospect's current business situation (authentic curiosity)
- Probe for prospect's needs (and confirm understanding of needs)
- Positive solution to meet those specific needs
- Handle objections
- Next steps
Tips:
- Get then talking about their business and then listen!
- Call low before a C-level conversation so you can find out how the business works and current challenges
- Ask for referrals. Who else should you talk to at other divisions / teams?
- Always work to schedule your next step while you're on the phone.
If the prospect is a good fit for your service, do NOT sell... rather, 1) help the prospect create a vision of a dream solution that will solve their problems; and then 2) connect your product to their key business issue(s) and dream solution.
If the prospect is interested but isn't ready, or they need to convince more people on the team, then turn your focus to developing your contact into a champion who can do the selling for you. Focus on what will make that person successful, and ask them how you can support them. Give them time.
5. Pass the baton
An SDR should pass an opportunity to an AE when:
- The company fits the ideal client profile
- SDR is speaking with someone with influence or power
- There is clear interest in a next step, usually in the form of a discovery call or demo with an Account Executive
Hand-off via hot-transfer or schedule a time on the calendars of your sales rep and new lead for a scoping/discovery/demo call.
The opportunity should be passed as a "Stage 1: New Prospect" opportunity and upgraded to "Qualified" when an Account Executive re-qualifies the opportunity.

Prospecting Best Practices
Create a "Day In The Life" templates (see pg. 78) that map out daily tasks, goals, and breaks.
Common prospecting mistakes:
- Expecting instant results... it can take 2-4 weeks or longer to develop a new qualified opportunity
- Writing long emails. State simply why you are reaching out and make it easy for them to respond by asking one simple question.
- Going wide but not deep (eg. hitting lots of accounts but only one contact at each and no follow-up emails)
- Giving up too quickly at ideal targets. Be "pleasantly persistent" and keep working to understand if there is a fit or not until you get a no from a real decision maker.
- Not giving up quickly enough at non-ideal targets.
- Depending on activity metrics rather than a proven process. "Dials per day" isn't nearly as useful as tracking "call conversations per day" or "appointments per week".
Prospecting tips:
- Call/email high and get referred down to the right person
- Be a non-threatening researcher, not a pushy salesperson.
- Always set up a next step... frame in a way that's valuable to them: "The best way for us to save time...", "Here's how I can help you get to a decision faster..."... "What we've found as a best next step is to..."
- If a prospect has a strong opinion on the next step (eg. "I'll need to see a demo"), don't fight them, take their next step with them and enhance their idea with what you want: "I'd be happy to set up a demo. As part of that prep process, it'll help make our time more productive if you fill out these five questions..."
Calling Tips
Lead with the line "Did I catch you at a bad time?"... takes prospect off the defensive and shows respect for time by asking permission to chat. If they say no, "When would be a better time to talk? Do you have your calendar handy?"
Tell them, honestly and directly, why you're calling... "I'm doing some research on your company to determine if we're a fit or not..."
Start with an easy question for them to answer, such as "May I ask how your [sales team | marketing org | research efforts...] is organized/structured?"
People like to talk about their business and it's harder to begin with a "What are your top challenges?" question because a) they don't trust you yet, and b) they may not have thought about their challenges.
If you've talked with someone who's helpful, but not the right person at that company... "If you were me, how would you approach your organization?"
Do you have your calendar handy? - never schedule by email if you can help it. Always get the next step on the calendar.

Sales Best Practices
Success Selling
Traditional "Always Be Closing" sales results in a lack of empathy with the prospect and tactics to generate short-term results like "buy now and get a month-end discount". Customers don't care at all whether you close the deal or not – they care abut improving their business.
Sell "past the close" with a "Success Plan"–a plan that paints a picture of the basic steps beyond deployment to actual client success. Success is not when your service is launched; it's when your service is successfully impacting the customer's business, such as when your software is adopted. The "plan" can be a half dozen bullet points in an email, agreed on with the client. Keep it simple. It should include a definition of what success means to the client, a few key milestones, and some responsibilities of both your company and the client.
You should also have a plan for client's ongoing success? Do you have a role in your company dedicated solely to helping customers become successful in using your product or service?
One of the tricks in "selling to success" is to not care too much about the close. Caring too much about the close will cause you to give off subconscious signals to the customer that you really don't care about their success, you care more about getting paid or getting your manager off your back.
If you and customer create a joint vision around how your company will make them successful, and they believe you, then the close becomes just a logical step in the progression to achieve that dream.
Obsess About the Decision Making Process, Not the Decision Maker
More and more, decisions are made collaboratively with influencers. It's perfectly good for a decision maker to refer you to their "get it done" people.
Avoid asking "who is the decision maker?". Instead, ask:
- "How have you evaluated similar products or services?"
- "What is the decision making process?"
- "Who is involved in making the decision?"
- "How will the decision be made?"
- "What are the steps to have a check cut or funds released?"
When asking bold questions, it's not what you ask, it's how you it. Ask it easily and confidently, and it can close the deal. Ask it in an insecure way and it will hurt you.
Design Free Trials to Maximize Conversion Rates
- Understand the prospect's true business issues before you begin
- Agree with the prospect on where the free trial fits in their buying process
- Focus on proving success with the fewest key areas/features.
"3-Hour-and-15-minute sales process"
Reps tend to waste a lot of time chasing early and stalled deals ("Hi Bob, just checking into see if anythings changed yet over there...")
Step 1: Take 15 minutes with them to figure out whether or not it's a waste of time to speak further. Lay out the process for the prospect in the best way to mutually figure out the fit, and position it in a way that benefits them. "We've found the best way to quickly figure out if there's a real fit or not just takes two steps: first, a more in-depth 'discovery' call with yourself and any other people you want to bring in. And then if that call goes well, a follow-up group white boarding session or call with the key people on your team who'd be involved so that we can determine if, how, and when we should work together".
Step 2: One hour qualification/discovery call with one or two of the prospect's point people. They want to see if they like you and what you're doing... your goal, if there is a fit, is to create a plan with the prospect to organize a working session that brings in their key people and decision makers to meet and create a vision together to determine if you should work together or not.
Step 3: Working session to create a joint vision together... walk them through a design process on how they can and will become successful with your product. Coach the vision out of them rather than telling it to them. White boarding is ideal, but it can be done over a call.
Prospects Should Earn Proposals
If you give out proposals too soon the prospect doesn't value it or your time, and you lose the chance to set up a specific next step that would help them earn the proposal.
Example: You do a demo, at the end of a demo they ask about pricing or a proposal, you say you'll include a proposal with a follow up email, you send the materials, you never hear from them again.
If you're not winning at least 50% of the proposals you're giving out, you're too easy.
Instead, next time when the prospect casually asks about pricing or getting a proposal, don't give it to them until you know they want it. Tell them you'd be happy to, and to do that, you'd need to set up a scoping call with them and the key people, to ensure the proposal is accurate and meets their needs.
If the prospect declines – then either they aren't a great prospect, or you didn't prove your value to them in your prior calls or demos.
If the prospect wants what you have, now you have another chance to focus your time with them and the other key people on creating a vision of how you can specifically solve their problems... and generate a proposal that nails it for them.

Lead Generation ("Seeds, Nets and Spears")
Teams commonly lack a shared understanding around lead types (what they are and what's different, eg. how well they qualify, how fast they close, ROI). "Seeds, Nets, and Spears" gives teams a simple way to come to a common understanding of their leads analysis:
- Seeds take a lot of time to cultivate and to ramp up, but once they get going, they are unbeatable with the highest conversion and close rates. Examples: happy customers (word of mouth), SEO, publishing expert content.
- Nets are marketing programs where you cast a wide net to see what you get, eg. conferences/events (see pg. 129), advertising, ppc.
- Spears are targeted outbound efforts.
Building mutual trust and commitment over time
Prospects like to get to know you first before they buy, and they want to do it on their own terms, and in their own time.
Give up trying to control how long someone takes to move forward. You'll have to accept that most prospects who initially sign up for a blog, trial or demo just won't be ready to do anything. Don't try to force them, instead consider if there's another onion layer you can create to offer to make it easier for them to take another step. Make it easier for prospects to "choose their own adventure" in how they get to know your company and its products (make sure you're also progressively getting to know prospects better as they get to know you). If you see prospects getting somewhere in your layers, consider redesigning your next-step offers. Trust that if there's a good mutual fit, and you keep nurturing them, and your "layers" are relevant and useful, they will become a customer someday.
Inbound Marketing Methods
In order of its ability to generate leads more easily:
- Referrals
- Free tools/free trials
- SEO
- Blogging
- Permission-based direct email marketing is still THE most important marketing technique to develop new leads and nurture old ones. Email marketing is important to establish your expertise, build relationships and trust, promote your webinars, and promote your products. At minimum, all you need your email system to do is share your blog posts via email and to invite people to events or webinars you're holding. As a rule of thumb, send an email at least one per month, and no more than 2x per week.
- Webinars get prospects coming back and interacting and learning from you, and offer an easy and compelling reason to spread the word to their friends about what you're doing. TEACH people something useful in the webinar. Make them "bigger than you" – eg. hold webinars in which customers are the presenters.
- PPC - some B2B companies with simple products or services use PPC as their sole or primary online marketing activity. The more trust-building and education your prospects need, the less likely PPC leads will convert into customers. While PPC sometimes can be a source of leads-on-demand, be careful to track their quality in terms of conversion rates to qualified opportunities and to closed deals.
- Affiliate Marketing / Joint Ventures - The best partners are bloggers or companies with large and trusting email audiences, and whose interests and values align with yours. Co-market or partner with them on a (disclosed) pet-for-performance basis in which they help promote your company in exchange for pay-per-lead or percentage-of-revenue basis.
- Social Media
Each method not only attracts new prospects but helps nurture existing ones.

Marketo Case Study
Market's "revenue funnel" has six stages: Awareness, Inquiry, Prospect, Lead, Opportunity, Customer

- Awareness: stage at which prospect first discovers the company, typically anonymously. Market tracks "Awareness Activity" by a) observing the number of known or anonymous visitors, or b_ searching for the keyword, "Marketo". Market believes that their "Modern B2B Marketing" blog is the main reason the market's awareness of them grow so quickly.
- Inquiry: stage at which anonymous lead becomes known by registering with a name and an email address for content, newsletter, etc. Market uses "progressive profiling" to ask for a bit more information each time a person registers for different pieces of content.
- Prospect: potential buyers with fewer than 56 pints based on lead scoring. Scoring is based on factors such as keywords, behavior/actions, demographics, etc. (pg. 122)
- Lead: prospect that scores above 65 points. The sales team knows it is definitely worth their time to follow up on the lead to qualify it and move it into a sales cycle. Closely track the percentage of new leads which turn into qualified opportunities by source (Marketo's conversion rates below)

Lead Lifecycle

Once a prospect becomes a lead, Marketo starts an automated 21-day lead lifecycle process. The process has multiple tracks and three outcomes.
Fast Track: If a lead archieves a score of 65+ AND fills out a contact me form or requests a free trial, these leads receive personal follow-up within five minutes of their activity (sales reps get an instant alert)
Normal Track: If a prospect reaches 65 points but doesn't match the fast track behavior, a sales task is set for the sales rep telling them to interact with this prospect within 24 hours. Sales rep does research and crafts a customized intro.
Marteko's qualification criteria
- Is there a Compelling Event?
- Has a Clear Key Pain or Need been identified?
- What are the current marketing tools and processes?
- What is the timeframe?
- What is the annual revenue/size of the company?
“21 Day Follow-Up” Campaign (For Prospects)
- Day 1: Evaluation: Over 65 points?
- Day 2: Market Phone Call and Send First Email
- Day 5: Content Offer Email (invitation to receive more content)
- Day 9: Phone Call
- Day 16: Email
- Day 21: Recycle
After the 21-day process there are three possible outcomes. A lead is either:
- Disqualified: A small fraction of leads that will never be a good fit.
- Converted to Opportunity (and handed off to a Account Executive)
- Recycled: Leads that aren't ready to engage with sales (eg. due to timing, lack of a clear need). These leads receive ongoing nurturing through email marketing... can have specific follow-up tasks/dates or reps can wait until a lead takes a new action and is again flagged as an active lead.
“Stay in Touch” Campaigns (For Prospects) “Drip Campaign”
- Prospects who do not actively engage go here
- Leads need time to ripen
- The key objective here is to build trust over time
Effective Prospect/Lead Nurturing
- Its about quality over quantity
- Make it valuable to them, not just you
- Make it bite-sized
- Match your content to buyer profiles
- Match your content to buying stages
- Get the timing right

Seven Fatal Sales Mistakes CEOs and Sales VPs Make
- Not taking responsibility for understanding sales and lead generation. Everything begins with the CEO. Even when a CEO hires executives to run lead generation and sales, the CEO cannot delegate their own understanding of how lead generation and sales works. The CEO must take responsibility for educating themselves and understanding the fundamentals in order to set effective goals, coach executives, and solve revenue problems.
- Having Account Executives be jacks-of-all-trades
- Assuming channels will do the selling for you. Channel partners usually won't or can't (because they're not good) sell for you.
- Hiring or promoting the wrong people, insufficient training, misguided ramp-up time expectations
- Not focusing and speaking to a targeted audience - how clear is your Ideal Customer Profile?
- Sloppy tracking and measurement
- Command-and-control management
Nine principles of building a sales machine
- Be patient. Developing a sales engine can take 4-12 months.
- Experiment constantly.
- Don't take on unrepeatable, one-off projects unless its an experiment to learn something for the future
- Get out of excel - operate out of your sales force automation system
- Sketch out how things work and what your processes are on a flow chart. If you can't sketch out your lead generation or sales process, that's a problem.
- Focus on results rather than activity.
- Track fewer, more important metrics (new leads created per month by source, conversion rate of leads to pop., volume and dollar value of qualified opp. created per month, conversion rates of pop. to closed deals, booked revenue)
- Pay special attention to "batons" that cross functions (marketing handing leads to sales, sales passing clients to account managers, ec)
- Take baby steps.
Separate the four core sales functions. Inefficiencies created by lumping include lack of focus, harder to develop talent, unclear metrics, and less visibility into problems. Four core roles: 1) inbound lead qualification, 2) outbound prospecting, 3) account executives, 4 account management/customer success
"We're too small to specialize yet"
Second person you hire, after a salesperson who can close, should be a SDR. Alternatively, use the 80/2/ rule. When your reps are, as a group, are spending more than 20% of their time on a secondary function, break out that function into a new role.
Cultivating talent
The best salespeople are the ones that have grown up in your company, and know it, your products, and your customers inside out.
The best kind of sales training is role-playing. (pg. 159)
Retaining Start Employees
Measuring satisfaction of your key employees (from First, Break All The Rules):
- Do I know what is expected of me at work?
- Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?
- At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
- In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for good work?
- Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person?
- Is there someone at work who encourages my development?
- At work, do my opinions seem to count?
- Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel like my work is important?
- Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?
- Do I have a best friend at work?
- In the last six months, have I talked with someone a bout my progress?
- At work, have I had opportunities to learn and grow?

#### 4. Challenger sale

What exactly does this mean?
It means approaching sales differently than you might’ve in the past. Rather than being apologetic about trying to sell to the customer, you’ll own the conversation. As a Challenger, you’ll have an in-depth understanding of your prospect's business and push back at the right moment to drive the customer toward making a decision.
Adamson and Dixon don’t just talk about Challengers in the book — they also go over four other types of sales reps. Though they all have distinct qualities, these categories aren’t mutually exclusive. The authors clarify that you can exhibit qualities of all types.
The five types of sales reps are:
- 		The Challenger (you): As a Challenger, you offer a new perspective to your prospect and don’t shy away from conversations about money. You understand what brings them value and leverage that information to deliver an irresistible pitch — and to tactfully pressure them. Remember the three T’s: You teach them something valuable, tailor the sales pitch, and take control over the conversation.
- 		The Hard Worker: The Hard Worker strives to get better in their role but doesn’t necessarily focus on the customer’s value drivers.
- 		The Lone Wolf: The Lone Wolf is a high performer but not necessarily a team player. Confident in their selling skills, they exceed quotas but are difficult to deal with interpersonally.
- 		The Relationship Builder: When you think of a salesperson, you’re thinking of the Relationship Builder. These sales reps get in contact with a gatekeeper at their target company and slowly try to create an internal advocate.
- 		The Problem Solver: The Problem Solver is adept at finding solutions for issues in both the team and the prospect’s business. They drive results by eagerly solving problems and keeping all stakeholders in the loop.
Now that you know the five profiles, it's time to put it all together by going over a summary of the book.
Challenger Sales Model Summary
Let’s sum it all up.
The Challenger Sales research revealed that every B2B sales rep falls into five different profiles.
The five types are the Challenger, the Hard Worker, the Lone Wolf, the Relationship Builder, and the Problem Solver. These profiles determine how a salesperson interacts with prospects and closes deals.
The “Challenger Approach” most correlated with increased close rates among high performers.
... hence the name of the book. In the study, Adamson and Dixon found that:
- 		40% of high sales performers primarily used a Challenger style.
- 		High performers were more than 2x likely to use a Challenger approach than any other approach.
- 		More than 50% of all star performers fit the challenger profile in complex sales.
- 		Only 7% of top performers took a relationship-building approach — the worst performing profile.
We should note that the Challenger approach only worked better among high performers. Among average performers, all profiles were roughly as successful as one another.
This is a disruptive finding, as most sales training and sales teams today are geared towards creating and encouraging the "Relationship Builder," the least effective of the five profiles.
The Challenger Sales model believes the other four sales profiles can learn to be a Challenger.
The Challenger Sales model posits that with the right training, coaching, and sales tools, all reps — even those falling into one of the other four categories — can take control of the customer conversation like a Challenger. It's therefore possible to create a high-performing Challenger Sales team, but it takes considerable effort and training.
There are four fundamental principles for implementing the Challenger Sales model.
They are:
- 		Challengers are made, not just born.
- 		It's the combination of skills that matters.
- 		Challenging is about organizational capability, not just an individual rep’s skills.
- 		Building the Challenger sales force is a journey, not an overnight trip.
By embracing these principles as you implement the Challenger Sales model, you'll take your sales process on a transformative journey and turn traditional solution selling on its head.
If you have the interest and authority to implement the model within your organization, there are some tips and tricks you can use to do so smoothly and effectively. Read on to find out how you can start training your sales reps using this model.
Challenger Sales Training
To train your sales team using the Challenger Sales model, you first need to recognize that results will vary from rep to rep — mostly depending on the type of salesperson they are. And you should expect some reps to shy away from this sales model.
If you’re not sure how to get started with sales training, check out our handy sales training template to get started.
Below, we’ll walk you through some ways you can teach different sales reps to better adopt the Challenger Sales model.
If you’re coaching a Hard Worker, consider doing the following:
- 		Walk through them through the "teaching" aspect of Challenger selling. As a Hard Worker, they’re self-motivated, but they may skip over certain parts of the process in pursuit of the sale.
- 		Give them consistent feedback to help them successfully adopt the Challenger Sales model.
- 		Hand out praise where it’s due — Hard Workers want to please, and this is a great way to motivate them.
If you’re coaching a Lone Wolf, consider doing the following:
- 		Teach them how to have fruitful two-way conversations with both teammates and prospects. A Lone Wolf is a highly effective sales rep, but they often go it alone and have less effective communication skills as a result.
- 		Give them a handout or a cheat sheet to remind them of the Challenger Sales method (or you could give them a link to this post).
- 		Let them figure it out on their own as the last step. As Lone Wolves, these types of sales reps thrive when they’re left on their own.
If you’re coaching a Relationship Builder, consider doing the following:
- 		Focus on the "pressuring" and "taking control" aspect of the sales model. Relationship Builders don’t want to rush things or feel like they’re pressing — but a key element of Challenger Sales is pushing back and being firm.
- 		Get them even more comfortable with the topic of money so that they don’t feel they’re sacrificing the relationship by talking about payment.
- 		Get them more acquainted with data and teach them to use it in the pitching process. Relationship Builders focus on empathy and connection, but those two don’t have to live apart from hard numbers and facts.
If you’re coaching a Problem Solver, consider doing the following:
- 		Bring to their attention the "offering a new perspective" aspect of Challenger Selling. In their quest to solve problems, a Problem Solver might rely on a tried and true method when instead they should be offering a unique view to change the customer’s perspective.
- 		Focus on creating pitches so specific to the customer’s problem, they simply can’t say no. After changing the customer’s perspective, the Problem Solver will then have to work to craft a highly specific solution that meets that prospect’s needs.
- 		Leverage the Problem Solver’s strong stakeholder communication skills to get buy-in from higher-ups at prospects’ organizations.
Use the Challenger Sales Model with Other Sales Methods
While every salesperson has a unique selling style, the Challenger Sales model can help you refine specific steps of your sales process, helping you close more deals and improve the bottom line at your company.


Top Insights Of The Challenger Sale
1) Firstly, the solution selling model is all about giving bundled offerings based on consulting.
2) Solution selling made things difficult and riskier for customers. This is because they seek sales based on consensus, and use 3rd party consultants to pass on a bit of the risk to the supplier.
3) The performance gap between average and star performers is 59 percent in transactional sales. Whereas it is 200 percent in solutions selling. 
4) There are five different sales reps. Those are the Hard Worker, the Relationship Builder, the Lone Wolf, the Reactive Problem Solver, and the Challenger. In most cases, especially in complicated sales scenarios, Challengers are dominant and account for 50% of star performers.
5) Challengers can use constructive tension to carry out three things – teach customers to compete better, tailor to match every stakeholder, and control the sales process.
6) Effective teaching involves identifying the unique value proposition of a supplier. The CEB survey showed that only 14 percent of companies offer benefits that customers found unique. 
7) The core question of the Commercial Teaching pitch is – “What is right now costing our customers more money than they realize that only we can help fix?”
8) According to CEB’s research, the main concern for the decision-maker is getting consensus across the organization.
9) Taking control of sales helps maintain momentum in the sales process. Challengers control the sale by teaching the customer how they should purchase a complex solution.
10) 63% of reports say that the managers lack the skills required to adapt to the sales model. 
11) The factors that matter in managerial excellence are selling skills, coaching, and sales innovation.
12) To turn a sales team into challengers, it is essential to convince managers to implement Challenger Selling across the organization.  

The ABC Myth
The “Always Be Closing” is a famous line from the movie Glengarry Glen Ross but that doesn’t mean that it is the ideal way to sell. Most of the top salespeople these days don’t do so. They are instead focussing on teaching people and enable them to find solutions for the challenges they face. Persuading prospects to buy a product or service has taken a back seat in this new digital age.

The Challenger Approach 
One finding in the sales study says that the sales experience is not the brand, price, service, or product that drives 53 percent of customer loyalty. Rather, the sales experience depends on how a rep interacts with customers. 
As per the study, you can categorize B2B sales reps into 5 different profiles. Each of them defines the skills and behaviors sales reps use to interact with customers. 
They are the following:



1. The Hard Worker – This kind of sales rep is self-motivated, and does not give up soon. They take interest in feedback and personal development.
2. The Lone Wolf – Such a sales rep follows his instincts and is self-assured. They do deliver results but is tough to manage.
3. The Relationship Builder – This sales rep is a classic consultative rep who builds relationships with prospects.
4. The Challenger – Such a sales rep has a different view of the world and loves to debate. Moreover, he understands the customer’s business well. 
5. The Problem Solver – This type of sales rep is detail-oriented and reliable. He tries to make sure that each and every problem gets resolved. 
‘The Challenger Sale’ talks about the ‘Challenger Approach’ that relates to the sales performance of top performers. 
The study revealed that 40 percent of high sales performers use a Challenger style and not the other four selling styles.
There is double the chance of high performers to use a Challenger approach as opposed to another one. 
More than half of the star performers use the challenger profile for complex sales. 
Only 7% of the top performers chose the relationship-building approach. 
The Challenger approach’s success rate increases with the complexity of the sales, but it works the best with high performers. For average performers, it was as successful as other approaches. 

Traits Of A Challenger Rep
a. Providing a unique perspective to a customer
b. Possessing solid two-way communication skills
c. Knowing about the value drivers of customers
d. Identifying what the economic drivers of a prospect’s business are
e. Talking about money comfortably
f. Having the ability to pressurize the customer in a good way 

‘The Challenger Sale’ defines a challenger rep by his ability to do 3 things:



a. Teach customers what they don’t know about. Additionally, provide valuable insights into competing in their market.
b. Tailor the sales pitch to meet the requirements of the decision-maker.
c. Take control of the pricing discussion and challenge the thinking of the customer around the issue.

Teach For Differentiation
In the book, the authors stress the fact that solution selling is not well-suited anymore. This is because customers have a lesser chance of investing time in helping sales reps find out their needs. As per their research, seven areas create a positive customer experience. They are,
1. A rep offering unique/valuable perspective in the market
2. A rep helping the customer find alternatives
3. A rep providing ongoing advice and consultation
4. A rep assisting the customer in avoiding possible problems
5. A rep educating the customer on new issues and outcomes
6. The supplier being easy to purchase from
7. The supplier has widespread support in the organization
The authors outline a teaching approach called “Commercial Teaching”. Here, the sales rep teaches the prospect how to think about their requirements. It is a new skill set that reps have to learn. Here are the six components a good teaching pitch should have,



1. The Warmer: Firstly, show the prospect that you understand their problems.
2. The Reframe: Relate the issues they face with a more significant challenge or opportunity they did not consider before. 
3. Rational Drowning: Show prospects why they should change the way they think.
4. Emotional Impact: Make an emotional connection in the story you are narrating. It has to show the pain they experience daily in their firm.
5. A new way: Then, convince them about your product or service and show them the fresh angle of looking at things.
6. Your solution: Finally, show how your answer is the best among the rest and how it is perfect as per the new way of thinking about the business.

Tailor For Resonance 
1. The art of building consensus
Research says that the biggest challenge decision-makers face is that of consensus in the organization. One way of closing a sale is by paying attention to the stakeholders of the organization. But eventually, to build peace, you have to educate end-users about the details of their businesses. 

2. The New Sale Flow
In the conventional sales model, reps get details from stakeholders to pitch their product or service to higher authorities. Thus, the main focus is on the bond between the rep and the decision-maker. On the other hand, in the challenger model, the connection between the sales rep and the stakeholder is strong. Hence, to close the deal, you would use a connection between the two.

3. Tailoring to Stakeholders
As per this model, reps have to talk to more stakeholders than they did before. The right way of tailoring messages is by starting at the industry level. And later getting into the organization and individual’s role. That is why challenger reps customize individual stakeholders based on customer outcomes. 

Here is the Solae story in ‘The Challenger Sale’,
Solae, a company manufacturing soy-based food ingredients, went for an expansion. However, the reps were in a difficult position as the count of stakeholders increased. But, Solae created Customer Outcomes Cards that had what every stakeholder cared about. It contained different kinds of details. This tool allows reps to know about the critical stakeholders for a solution and their important outcomes. 
For sales, Solae uses a template to record customer buy-in. It makes use of Customer Outcomes Cards. Then, reps ask stakeholders to sign on the template. Upon carrying out the final conversation with the decision-maker, they present the document as proof of consensus across the whole organization. Subsequently, in Solae’s approach, they look upon all the stakeholders as customers. 

Take Control of the Sale
When you take control of the sale, two things occur, 
1. The ability to make the sales process moving 
2. Keep discussion of finances comfortable 
You can turn down discounts only when you are confident that you created value by educating the customer on what they didn’t know previously. Challengers take control of the sale by educating customers on the process of purchasing a complex solution.
They make the customer look at the challenges from a fresh perspective. When the customer tries to ask for a discount, the challenger will present them with data and insights. Here the challenger does push the customer but without being aggressive. 
1. The Misplaced Fear of Aggression
‘The Challenger Sale’ says that there is a baseless fear that encouraging reps to be assertive can make them aggressive. Reps feel that the power lies with the customer, and that is why they are passive. One reason for this behavior is that reps tend to undermine the value of the company they are a part of. Most often, they don’t seem to value the technical ability and expertise of the firm. 
Taking control means knowing that you are bringing value to the customer. Try giving them new perspectives to look at things. Another reason for passivity is the customer-centric approach that has been in use for too long. 
Here’s how DuPont takes control,
DuPont is a company that enables reps to take control when there is a negotiation. This is done with the help of a template for pre-negotiation planning. The template notes the supplier’s power position, such as brand, pricing, product, and much more. There is documentation of areas of strengths and weaknesses as well. Doing so gives the rep a clear idea of the value of what he is selling and gives him the confidence to move ahead with the negotiation. Thus, this will help prepare the sales rep to face the customer’s questions, and understand the supplier’s needs. Then he can better identify what concessions he can give.
2. Carrying Out a Successful Negotiation
There is a 4-step framework that DuPont uses for negotiation,
1) Acknowledge and Defer – Customers may pressurize reps for a discount. The rep agrees to work on it but asks for time to understand the client’s needs better. This way, he can create more value. Hence, the rep gets the time from the customer and creates creative tension.
2) Deepen and Broaden – The rep requests the customer to let him know about their needs. Then, identifies the solution to serve. Doing so will make the customer identify the value of the solution.
3) Explore and Compare – Analyze different trade-offs to see options that don’t affect the margins but offer customer value.
4) Concede as per the plan – Determining what, when, and how to concede is crucial while negotiating with the customer. Planning the sequences is essential.

The New Sales Manager
You need sales managers to implement the Challenger model for sales. However, 63% of the members of CEB report that their managers lack the skills they require for evolving the sales model. 3 high-level factors matter: selling skills, coaching, and sales innovation.

1. Coaching 
The dimensions of coaching have the following dimensions,
a. It is ongoing
b. It is tailor-made for each rep
c. The focus is not on knowledge but on behavior

2. Pause before coaching
To become experts in coaching others during sales interactions, there is a framework called PAUSE,



P- Prepare for the coaching conversion – When a rep prepares in advance, there’s a kind of continuity between subsequent sessions of coaching.
A- Affirm the relationship – There has to be an emphasis on personal development by keeping performance management discussion aside. 
U- Understand expected behavior – Teach managers what to observe and what to look out to handle the conversations in coaching better.
S- Specify Behaviour Change – Give managers a set of behaviors and standards to give feedback.
E- Embed New Behaviours – Institutionalize the coaching.

3. Drive Sales Innovation
 Following three key activities drive sale innovation,
1. Investigation
2. Creation
3. Sharing
Investigating involves working with the rep and finding out what is preventing the deal from moving ahead. 
Creating solutions involves mapping supplier capabilities to resolve customer challenges as well as creating opportunities for cross-selling. 
Talking about sharing, great managers tend to share their innovative efforts so that reps replicate them. 
Coaching helps in enhancing known behaviors, but innovation works in handling unforeseen situations.
As a sales manager, you would want reps to challenge customers using new methods. Some reps have a natural inclination towards the challenger model, but others too can learn it. 
You can provide reps with plenty of information about different industries and companies to customize pitches according to that. Then, you can create cheat sheets explaining the objectives for different positions in specific industries. Further, managers have to teach sales reps how they can be successful as challengers. They can do this by sharing what they learned from other salespeople in the same kind of situation. 

Implementing The Challenger Model
1. What sales leaders must know
a. Every high-performer is not a challenger. You have to identify challengers properly to see their sales behavior. 
b. Be careful about allowing lone wolves to become dominant in the organization.
c. You should train reps on the Challenger model, but at the same time, it is essential to hire challengers. 
d. Make the most out of the Challenger model by developing individual skills and organizational ability side by side. 
e. It is not enough to do sales training. Focus on creating receptivity before the sales training and come up with a structured training approach. 

2. What marketing leaders must know
a. To be customer-centric in the real sense, you have to be insight-centric. Moreover, you have to generate unique insights that teach customers to act differently.
b. It is most important to identify the supplier’s unique value proposition. You can’t have a Challenger model without it. 
c. Stand out in the crowd of competitors. You can do so by creating a challenging way with your main focus on the customer’s pain points.  

3. What senior management should know
a. It is enough to go in for 80 percent adoption of the Challenger model instead of complete adoption to shift your organization’s behavior. 
b. You have to be ready to accept the fact that 20 to 30 percent of the sales reps will not switch to the Challenger Model.
c. Use the power of terminology to your benefit.
d. You can customize the execution of the Challenger model so that you meet the norms of behavior. 

The Takeaways
1) In today’s world, a customized and personalized product or service is the main selling factor. Previously, sales depended on the sales rep’s ability, but there has now been a shift. Now it has become customer-oriented.
2) In the digital age, sales rest on the ‘Challenger’ type of salespersons. The challenger type is the one who understands the needs of customers. Moreover, provides them with innovative solutions. 
3) A challenger salesperson directs the conversation with the customer. They convince them about the effectiveness of his solution from different perspectives.
4) A challenger controls the sale right from the beginning.
5) To build a “challenger” sales team, a sales manager must take everybody on board. This involves sharing knowledge and solutions.
6) Managers are crucial entities that facilitate the execution of strategies the higher management defines.

#### 5. Sell the way you buy

Do you like talking to salespeople? What’s the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the world ‘sales’? The overwhelming experience we had with salespeople over the years were primarily self interested and manipulative. This book is here to change that – to change the way you sell by shifting the focus away from you and towards your customers.
 
Do not ask this question.
Selling is about asking questions, but there’s one question you should never ask. The question “Does that make sense?” feels wrong on many levels. First, it sounds as an insult to the customer’s intelligence. Second, it implies that you as a seller simply aren’t good at explaining things. It sends the other person a signal that you’re not good at explaining things and your words often leave people with a sense of confusion and bewilderment. 
 
When asking for time, frame a ‘no’ response.
Of these two questions, which one do you think comes across as more comfortable for the other person? 
- Hi Mary, this is David calling from Acme. Do you have a few minutes to chat?
- Hi Mary, this is David calling from Acme. Have I caught you at a bad time?
The second introduction is more effective because it’s designed to solicit a ‘no’ response from the customer – a much safer and more comfortable emotional position for them. 
 
Avoid prescription without diagnosis.
David recalls having a conversation with the client who insists on getting a quotation without first explaining their context. David simply said, “The good news is we can absolutely solve the business problems you’re experiencing and we’d love to help. The problem is we believe the solution requirements you’ve outlined in the RFP won’t solve those problems. On the flip slide, there are key solution features we know you’re absolutely going to need that you haven’t asked about in the RFP.”  The client eventually recognized David’s authentic desire to help and gave him the opportunity to lead.
 
ROI doesn’t always influence purchase decisions.
Consider purchasing the latest technology and gadgets or spending on experiences like travels and concerts. Now think about the ROI on those spending decisions. It’s hard to tell. Yes, maxing out your credit card to buy the latest smartphone with high-end specs and camera might increase your productivity. And going on a Caribbean cruise might help reduce your stress levels. While most buyers certainly see value in a strong ROI, those reasons rarely are the primary motivators for purchasing decisions.

Sell the product AND experience.
Disney isn’t alone in their relentless focus on customer experience. Companies like Amazon, Porsche, Southwest Airlines and Netflix all place a heavy emphasis on the entire customer journey.
Consider a commodity like an Apple iPad. Thousands of iPads roll off the same assembly line, only to be sold by different retailers. But if you were given a choice of purchasing an iPad at your local big-box electronic store or an official Apple outlet, which one would you choose?  By far, the Apple store is cooler, the staff are friendlier, know their stuff and take their time to answer all your questions. And people like walking out the store with that white bag. But the experience doesn’t end there. Suppose you have some problems with your newly purchased iPad. You call Apple service. Would your perception of the experience change if you have to wait forty minutes on the line to speak to someone rude and unhelpful? Absolutely.
From consideration to purchase and from purchase to renewal, your customer experience efforts should reflect end-to-end, as each and every step plays a key part in the customer journey.
 
Leverage the fear of loss.
For most people, the fear of a loss tends to loom larger than the desire for a similar gain. The answer may simply lie in the behavioral pathways established by our ancestors. The primary function of our brain is to protect us from danger by learning and adapting from one experience to the next (for our ancestors it’s much more motivating not to be a dinner than to have a dinner).
“If you’re like most companies, you’re losing revenue every day from customers abandoning their shopping carts on your website. My solution can help solve that problem.” That is how you lead with a loss-centric message. If your buyers can’t internalize the magnitude of the loss, your efforts will most likely fall on deaf ears.

If you’re selling a band aid, ‘cut’ them first.
Most sales people will go one of these two ways:
- Look for people who’re afraid they might get cut and sell them a band aid
- Look for people with cuts and sell them a band aid
The first option sounds sensible but this is actually a gain statement masquerading as a potential loss because the loss has yet to happen. What we’re selling really is an insurance policy against a future downside. From gym memberships to smoke detectors to retirement investment plans, we see many examples on this approach. The problem is our buyers may not appreciate the magnitude of the problem until they experience it themselves.
“Most buyers don’t realize how badly they’re bleeding. In some cases, they don’t know they’re bleeding at all.”
The second option – selling band aids to those who are already cut – is more efficient and sensible. With a clear and present pain, buyers are much more motivated to take action.
 
Crafting a message that ‘cut’.
Here are some marketing messages we see every day “Move your data to the cloud”, “Look ten years younger”, “Boost employee engagement”, “Stop snoring and sleep better.” They sound like problems but they’re too easy to ignore.
How about we ‘cut them a little bit?  “We help employees get the feedback they need to perform their best and their careers.”, “We help managers become great coaches.”, “We help promote your amazing culture by making winning behavior visible.” The prospects will be much more responsive to your pitch.
But let’s not stop here. Let’s precede the ‘cut’ with some facts. “Seventy percent of people leave their company because of a poor relationship with their manager”, “Most millennial employees use the word ‘hate’ to describe how they feel about performance reviews.”, “Four out of ten employees are actively disengaged at work and cost companies millions in lost productivity.” The messages are much more striking, laden with specific and compelling statistics. And they also invoke real business pains. They help the customers internalize what they’re already suffering from and that they’re in need of a band aid.
 
5 Techniques to Serve Information that Sells
- Polarization
- Juxtaposition
- Provocative Questions
- Conviction
- Storytelling
Technique #1 Polarization – Who’s Your Enemy?
Polarizing messages can serve double duty by keeping the good-fit customers in and helping the bad-fit customers out. Consider these two messages:
- “When it comes to making truly delicious hamburgers, the Burger King flame-grilled cooking process beats McDonald’s flat grills hands down.”
- “When it comes to making truly delicious hamburgers, we believe cooking them over an open flame makes all the difference.”
Or how about these;
- “At SmallCo Financial, we strive to deliver world-class service at fees that are much lower than BigCo Financial.”
- “At SmallCo Financial, our goal is to be the world’s best low-fee provider by cutting out those calls centers you hate calling anyways!”
In both examples, the messages are focused on polarizing the audience with a specific viewpoint, but the second approach comes across as more professional and secure (without getting in the way of anyone).
Technique #2 Juxtaposition – Converting Through Comparison
Consider the two signs below:

Both are designed to encourage pet wonders to pick up after their dogs. But one simply calls to action without catalyzing the reason behind it. Another appeals to the owner’s good nature and social responsibility. Which one you think would perform better? Which message you think is harder for pet owners to ignore? The second message creates a visceral emotional reaction that drives both rapid clarity and desired behavior. 
Another way to produce rapid clarity is to use data. Here’s an example:
- “People love feedback but they hate performance reviews.”
- “People love feedback but according to the latest research, 80 percent of millennial use the word ‘hate’ to describe performance reviews.”
Or how about this:
- “Most IT leaders feel their networks are secure and are actually using inadequate safeguards.”
- “Seventy-five percent of IT leaders feel their networks are secure, yet the incidence of data breaches has increased 40 percent in the past three years alone.”
In both cases, the second approach not only creates a higher degree of contrast, the knowledge and intimacy it offers through the use of data produces a compounding persuasive effect. The result is buyers will not only feel the pain – your knowledge in the area of that pain will make them see you as someone who can help ease that pain. 
Technique #3 Provocative Questions – Lead with Questions, Not Solutions
Questions, especially provocative ones, open up the conversation or discussion. Consider these solution-enemy pairings. Here are three simple steps to lead with provocative questions:
- Find the enemy
- Pair it with solution
- Craft a question that implicitly names the enemy
Here’s an example of solution-enemy pairing:
Enemy
Solution
Lack of time to exercise
Highly efficient exercise machine
Lack of exercise about how customers interact with your mails
Email tracking software
Wasting energy and money on heating and cooling
Smart-home thermostat
Here’s an example of crafting a question that implicitly names an enemy:
Enemy
Question
Lack of time to exercise
Ever feel like you never have enough time to exercise?
Lack of insight about how customers interact with your mails
Don’t you want to know what happens after you sit?
Wasting energy and money on heating and cooling
Do you know how much money you’re wasting when your furnace is running and you’re not at home?
Technique #4 Conviction – Lead with What You Believe
Enter the power of ‘why’. You might craft belief statements like:
- “I believe most of us don’t like talking to salespeople, yet we find ourselves in selling situations of our own all the time.”
- “I believe salespeople are not bad people. They’re just using old, outdated tactics that don’t work because that’s what they were taught.”
If you can make your customers believe what you believe, they’ll lean and ask for more. You should aim for the response “tell me more!” from your customers. Here are three tips:
- Point to a specific well-understood but not often articulated challenge
- Don’t refer to your offering directly
- Ask yourself “Will someone that I talk to be smiling and nodding?” 
Technique #5 Storytelling – Tell the Story of Your Solution
Here’s  a simple, our-step breakdown for a typical infomercial pitch.
- The Problem
- The Ideal Solution (not your solution)
- The Problem with that ideal solution
- Enter Your Solution
Here’s an example:
“Hey do you want to lose weight and get in the best shape of your life? Well the best way to do that is to go to the gym five days a week and work out for one hour each time.  But… gym memberships are expensive and who has that kind of time just lying around?
What you need is our awesome, cost-effective, home-exercise machine. 
Here’s another:
“Eating too many processed foods is destroying your health. The solution is to eat more fresh fruits , vegetables and juices. The problem is that atypical juicers are too large, time-consuming to use, expensive, hard to clean and kill too many of your food’s helpful nutrients.
Our awesome, compact, easy-to-clean and affordable juice machine is just what you need!
 
A Simple Approach to Help Your Customers Open up
Here’s what NOT to do:
- “Let’s talk about your needs. I’m free on Wed at 2:30pm. Will that work for you?”
- “Is there any reason why you won’t be able to make a purchase decision on this product today?
- “After our initial discovery call today, I’d like to schedule a meeting with your executive team.”
Now, here’s what to do:
- “If you free a quick, no pressure discovery chat makes sense, here’s a link to my calendar. Feel free to pick a time that works best for you.”
- “It sounds like we have a good fit here. And if you’re interested in moving forward today, I’d love to help… but I’d also be happy to discuss a timeline that works best for you.”
- “I appreciate you taking the time to chat today. If the call goes well, most clients find a meeting with your executive team to be a helpful next step, but we can decide on that once we get there. And if for some reason you feel it doesn’t make sense to move forward, that’s okay too. I’d still be happy to share a package of free resources to help you on your way.”
 
Don’t push, but don’t go soft either.
After all, inertial, status quo bias and the dreaded ‘do nothing’ option all have very strong gravitational pulls and in many instances, your buyers will take the status quo unless you give them a strong reason not to.

Know your audience. Label their pain.
As you begin conversation with your prospects, one of the things you might say is “I speak to customers in your position every day, and the number one challenge I hear from them is…….” To get the most out of labelling, your label needs to be specific, differentiated and not sound like a high-level pitch that caters to everyone.
Here’s an example of what NOT to do:
- “I speak to sales leaders like you every day who are looking for a better, more effective CRM.”
- “I speak to HR leaders like you everyday who are looking to automate and accelerate their performance review process.”
Here’s an example of what to do:
- “I speak to sales leaders every day and what I hear consistently is that they don’t always trust that the information in their CRM is up to date.”
- “I speak to progressive HR leaders every day who tell me their people love feedback but they hate performance reviews.”
 
Ask “On a scale of 1 to 10…” questions.
These questions are perhaps one of the very best you can ask in a discovery situation. They’re completely subjective and opinion-based. All you have to do is
- Ask your customer to rate their pain (on a scale of 1 to 10)
- Provide some examples as a baseline
- Listen and then ask them why they chose a number they do
Let’s say your customer chose 6. You might follow up and ask “I see. Why did you choose 6?” And from there the conversation could continue. You might also ask “I see. You say you’re a 6 but why wouldn’t you be a seven or eight? Or “What would it take to get you to a seven or eight?” 
 
2 Strategies to Seek Clarifications
Strategy #1 Ask and Soften
- Buyer: “This isn’t a priority right now.”
- You: “I totally get it. You have many things going on and need to give the most important things the most attention… If you don’t mind me asking, what’s on top of your mind right now?”
Strategy #2 Mirror
- Buyer: “This isn’t a priority right now.”
- You: “I’m sorry… not a priority for you now?”
 
10 Strategies to Handle Objections

Strategy #1 Resolve with Empathy
- Buyer: “I really like that suit, but it’s a little too expensive for what I was hoping to spend.”
- Seller: “I completely understand how you feel. It’s a nice one and you don’t have to spend that amount if it makes you feel better. What my clients found in the end was that spending a few extra dollars on a timeless design for years was a worthwhile investment.”
Strategy #2 Historical Perspective
- Buyer: “We’ve had a solid solution in place for many years that seems to be working well. I don’t think we need a solution like yours.”
- Seller: “I completely understand. The solution you have now was the gold standard for many years. The problem is now hackers have become much more sophisticated which is why many companies are turning to this type of technology.”
Strategy #3 Reason with Satisfaction
- Buyer: “I used to have a 25 percent discount on my cell phone program. I’d like you to reapply it to my new program.”
- Seller: “I’m sorry. I’d love to be able to do that, but I can’t because we don’t offer that promotion anymore.”
Strategy #4 Turn Future into Past
- Buyer: “I like your product, but it’s too expensive.”
- 
- Seller: “I understand. If you don’t mind me asking, what would happen if the product was free? Of course, I’m sure it would be a nice fit, but I’m just wondering if price is the only thing preventing us from moving forward.”
Strategy #5 Consider the Alternative
- Buyer: “your product seems to have a lot of features and a hefty price tag to match. It might make sense for us to go with a simpler, less expensive product that just has the features we need.”
- Seller: “I totally understand. You don’t want to pay for the features you don’t feel you’d use, and that approach might make sense. When we spoke last week you mentioned you had aggressive plans to grow and scale your business. While you may not need those features now, do you think you’d be able to meet your growth targets without them six months from now? What happens if you grow faster than you thought?”
Strategy #6 De-escalate
In the case of the child who is afraid of the closet monster, you might walk them to the closet, turn on the light, shuffle some clothes around and do one more spot check under the bed for good measure before confirming to them with utmost certainty that their bedroom is monster-free. In the case of the customer who raises an objection, you might respond with a softening statement to acknowledge their fears and then raise a logical position to help frame the compliance to the request.
Strategy #7 Turn Weakness into Strength
- Buyer: “I don’t think moving to a new supplier before the busy holiday season makes sense. It introduces too much operational risk at a time when our customers really count on us.”
- Seller: “I completely understand how you feel. You don’t want to risk any logistical problems during your busiest time of the year. Interestingly, I’ve worked with many clients like you who felt the same way. But what they found was that switching suppliers in advance of their busy season actually allowed them to provide a much better customer experience and rice even more revenue than they had previously projected.”
- 
Strategy #8 Validate the Fit
- Buyer: “Wow.. that’s much more than I was thinking this would cost!”
- Seller: “I understand. Sometimes people are surprised by how much my type of service costs. But customers typically bring me in to solve their most unique and difficult searches, the ones they’ve been challenged to solve on their own. While I’m very good at what I do, I know my service isn’t for everyone. So if this doesn’t make sense for you, please don’t feel bad. That’s totally fine.”
Strategy #9 Inoculate
- Seller: “As I learn more about your needs and craft a proposal, I wanted to mention that we’re definitely not the lowest-cost provider out there. We might even be the first or second-most expensive. While our price is higher than most, our mission is to deliver a high-touch, comprehensive solution that consistently exceeds our customer’s expectation. That’s why we have a 96 percent customer retention rate.”
Strategy #10 Bring It!
- Seller: “Do you have any concerns around X?”, “What do you feel we’re missing in terms of the approach we’ve outlined?”, “How confident do you feel you’d see success from our solution?”
 
No one strategy that works all the time.
Like a skilled chef, most effective sellers in the modern era are familiar with all manner of techniques, styles and schools of thought. Only then, will they be able to select the right approach for the right situation. Because selling is an exercise in human communications and given the hundreds of variables that influence how two humans will interact with each other on any given day, there is really no one-size-fits-all solution.
 
The knowing-doing gap is very real.
Everything you’ve read so far is easy to digest but that doesn’t mean you’ll be able to pull off every concept with skill, finesse and tone of the best sellers. When you start to apply your knowledge, it’s okay to suck at it. If you revisit the outcome of each of your interactions and question why you were successful or not, your brain will create new pathways for you to get a desired outcome next time.
